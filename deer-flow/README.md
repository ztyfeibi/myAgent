> On February 28th, 2026, DeerFlow claimed the 🏆 #1 spot on GitHub Trending following the launch of version 2. Thanks a million to our incredible community — you made this happen! 💪🔥

DeerFlow (**D**eep **E**xploration and **E**fficient **R**esearch **Flow**) is an open-source **super agent harness** that orchestrates **sub-agents**, **memory**, and **sandboxes** to do almost anything — powered by **extensible skills**.

> [!NOTE]
> **DeerFlow 2.0 is a ground-up rewrite.** It shares no code with v1. If you're looking for the original Deep Research framework, it's maintained on the [`1.x` branch](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/tree/main-1.x) — contributions there are still welcome. Active development has moved to 2.0.

## One-Line Agent Setup

If you use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, or another coding agent, you can hand it the setup instructions in one sentence:

```text
Help me clone DeerFlow if needed, then bootstrap it for local development by following https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytedance/deer-flow/main/Install.md
```

That prompt is intended for coding agents. It tells the agent to clone the repo if needed, choose Docker when available, and stop with the exact next command plus any missing config the user still needs to provide.

## Quick Start

### Configuration

1. **Clone the DeerFlow repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
   cd deer-flow
   ```

2. **Run the setup wizard**

   From the project root directory (`deer-flow/`), run:

   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

   This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through choosing an LLM provider, optional web search, and execution/safety preferences such as sandbox mode, bash access, and file-write tools. It generates a minimal `config.yaml` and writes your keys to `.env`. Takes about 2 minutes.

   The wizard also lets you configure an optional web search provider, or skip it for now.

   Run `make doctor` at any time to verify your setup and get actionable fix hints.
   If you are opening a GitHub issue about a local setup or runtime problem, run
   `make support-bundle`. The command prints reporter next steps, writes a
   `*-issue-summary.md` file to paste into the issue, a `*-issue-draft.md` file
   for AI-assisted issue filing, and an optional evidence zip under
   `.deer-flow/support-bundles/`. If an AI assistant files the issue, start from
   the draft and replace every REQUIRED placeholder instead of inventing missing
   facts. Attach the zip only if a maintainer asks for it, or if the summary
   alone is not enough. Maintainers and AI triage tools can start with
   `triage.json`; the bundle includes redacted diagnostics and file manifests
   only, and does not include `.env`, raw conversation messages, or user file
   contents.

   > **Advanced / manual configuration**: If you prefer to edit `config.yaml` directly, run `make config` instead to copy the full template. See `config.example.yaml` for the complete reference including CLI-backed providers (Codex CLI, Claude Code OAuth), OpenRouter, Responses API, subagent runtime caps such as `subagents.max_total_per_run`, and more.

   Optional per-model pricing must use one currency across all priced models.
   DeerFlow disables Console cost estimates when currencies are mixed rather
   than presenting an invalid aggregate.

   <details>
   <summary>Manual model configuration examples</summary>

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4o
       display_name: GPT-4o
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: gpt-4o
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY

     - name: openrouter-gemini-2.5-flash
       display_name: Gemini 2.5 Flash (OpenRouter)
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview
       api_key: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY
       base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

     - name: gpt-5-responses
       display_name: GPT-5 (Responses API)
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI
       model: gpt-5
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
       use_responses_api: true
       output_version: responses/v1

     - name: qwen3-32b-vllm
       display_name: Qwen3 32B (vLLM)
       use: deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel
       model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B
       api_key: $VLLM_API_KEY
       base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
       supports_thinking: true
       when_thinking_enabled:
         extra_body:
           chat_template_kwargs:
             enable_thinking: true
   ```

   OpenRouter and similar OpenAI-compatible gateways should be configured with `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` plus `base_url`. If you prefer a provider-specific environment variable name, point `api_key` at that variable explicitly (for example `api_key: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

   To route OpenAI models through `/v1/responses`, keep using `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` and set `use_responses_api: true` with `output_version: responses/v1`.

   For vLLM 0.19.0, use `deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel`. For Qwen-style reasoning models, DeerFlow toggles reasoning with `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` and preserves vLLM's non-standard `reasoning` field across multi-turn tool-call conversations. Legacy `thinking` configs are normalized automatically for backward compatibility. If the endpoint reports a cumulative usage snapshot on every streaming chunk, set `cumulative_stream_usage: true` so DeerFlow converts those snapshots into per-chunk deltas; the option is disabled by default and leaves usage unchanged when a stable completion id is unavailable. Reasoning models may also require the server to be started with `--reasoning-parser ...`. If your local vLLM deployment accepts any non-empty API key, you can still set `VLLM_API_KEY` to a placeholder value.

   CLI-backed provider examples:

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-5.4
       display_name: GPT-5.4 (Codex CLI)
       use: deerflow.models.openai_codex_provider:CodexChatModel
       model: gpt-5.4
       supports_thinking: true
       supports_reasoning_effort: true

     - name: claude-sonnet-4.6
       display_name: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Claude Code OAuth)
       use: deerflow.models.claude_provider:ClaudeChatModel
       model: claude-sonnet-4-6
       max_tokens: 4096
       supports_thinking: true
   ```

   - Codex CLI reads `~/.codex/auth.json`
   - Claude Code accepts `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
   - ACP agent entries are separate from model providers — if you configure `acp_agents.codex`, point it at a Codex ACP adapter such as `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp`
   - MiniMax Code speaks ACP directly. Install and authenticate it, then add it as an ACP agent:

   ```bash
   npm install --global @minimax-ai/code
   mcode login
   ```

   ```yaml
   acp_agents:
     mcode:
       command: mcode
       args: ["acp"]
       description: MiniMax Code for implementation, refactoring, debugging, and repository tasks
       auto_approve_permissions: false
   ```

   `mcode` must be on the Gateway process's `PATH`; installing it only on the Docker host does not make it available inside the Gateway container. DeerFlow invokes it through `invoke_acp_agent` in a per-thread ACP workspace and forwards enabled MCP servers. Keep `auto_approve_permissions: false` for untrusted tasks; enable it only when MCode must edit files or run commands and you trust the task.
   - On macOS, export Claude Code auth explicitly if needed:

   ```bash
   eval "$(python3 scripts/export_claude_code_oauth.py --print-export)"
   ```

   API keys can also be set manually in `.env` (recommended) or exported in your shell:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   ```

   </details>

### Running the Application

#### Deployment Sizing

Use the table below as a practical starting point when choosing how to run DeerFlow:

| Deployment target | Starting point | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Local evaluation / `make dev` | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB free SSD | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM | Good for one developer or one light session with hosted model APIs. `2 vCPU / 4 GB` is usually not enough. |
| Docker development / `make docker-start` | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 25 GB free SSD | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM | Image builds, bind mounts, and sandbox containers need more headroom than pure local dev. |
| Long-running server / `make up` | 8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 40 GB free SSD | 16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM | Preferred for shared use, multi-agent runs, report generation, or heavier sandbox workloads. |

- These numbers cover DeerFlow itself. If you also host a local LLM, size that service separately.
- Linux plus Docker is the recommended deployment target for a persistent server. macOS and Windows are best treated as development or evaluation environments.
- If CPU or memory usage stays pinned, reduce concurrent runs first, then move to the next sizing tier.

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

Requires Docker Desktop / Docker Engine and **Docker Compose v2.24+**
(`docker compose version`). Older Compose clients cannot parse the optional
`env_file` syntax in `docker/docker-compose-dev.yaml`.

**Development** (hot-reload, source mounts):

```bash
make docker-init    # Pull sandbox image (only once or when image updates)
make docker-start   # Start services (auto-detects sandbox mode from config.yaml)
make docker-logs    # View logs
```

`make docker-start` starts `provisioner` only when `config.yaml` uses provisioner mode (`sandbox.use: deerflow.community.aio_sandbox:AioSandboxProvider` with `provisioner_url`).

Docker builds use the upstream `uv` registry by default. If you need faster mirrors in restricted networks, export `UV_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` and `NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com` before running `make docker-init` or `make docker-start`.

Local AIO sandbox control traffic is always direct: loopback/private addresses,
single-label cluster hosts, and Docker/Podman internal hostnames do not inherit
`HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`. External sandbox FQDNs and public IPs still
honor environment proxy settings.

Backend processes automatically pick up `config.yaml` changes on the next config access, so model metadata updates do not require a manual restart during development.
The checkpoint storage settings `database.checkpoint_channel_mode` and
`database.checkpoint_delta.snapshot_frequency` (default `10`) are exceptions:
both are frozen when the process first builds an agent (including through
`DeerFlowClient`) and require a process restart to change safely.

The optional `database.checkpoint_cache` section (delta channel mode only)
caches materialized checkpoint histories: `type` is `memory` (default) or
`redis`, and `max_entries: 0` disables the cache. The `redis` backend is
Gateway/async-only; the sync TUI/embedded path supports `memory` only. The
cache is performance-only — results are identical with it disabled — so it is
never frozen and workers sharing one checkpoint database may safely run
different cache settings.

> [!TIP]
> On Linux, if Docker-based commands fail with `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, add your user to the `docker` group and re-login before retrying. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#linux-docker-daemon-permission-denied) for the full fix.

**Production** (builds images locally, mounts runtime config and data):

```bash
make up     # Build images and start all production services
make down   # Stop and remove containers
```

Access: http://localhost:2026

`make up` waits for the Gateway `/health` endpoint before reporting success.
If the Gateway does not become healthy within the startup window, deployment
exits non-zero and prints the container status plus recent Gateway logs. The
production image starts from its already-built environment and never resolves
or installs Python dependencies at container startup.

For persistent deployments, configure `database.backend` as `sqlite` or
`postgres`. The selected backend is shared by the LangGraph checkpointer,
LangGraph Store, and DeerFlow application data. The deprecated `checkpointer`
section, when present, overrides the first two for backward compatibility.

The unified nginx endpoint is same-origin by default and does not emit browser CORS headers. If you run a split-origin or port-forwarded browser client, set `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS` to comma-separated exact origins such as `http://localhost:3000`; the Gateway then applies the CORS allowlist and matching CSRF origin checks.

Browser login uses `HttpOnly` session cookies. The login page offers a "keep me signed in" option that extends the browser session when the request is HTTPS (including trusted `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`) or localhost HTTP. The localhost exception uses the direct request `Host` and ignores forwarded host headers. Public HTTP deployments, including many temporary sandbox URLs, fall back to session cookies by default. DeerFlow never stores the password in browser storage; the UI may remember only the email address.

DeerFlow still uses `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-*` headers to recover the browser-facing scheme and origin behind a proxy. The bundled nginx sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`, but preserves an upstream HTTPS value and does not overwrite every forwarded header. Configure the outer trusted proxy to replace or strip client-supplied forwarding headers before traffic reaches DeerFlow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Gateway still owns active run tasks in process, so production defaults to a single Gateway worker (`GATEWAY_WORKERS=1`). Multi-worker deployments require Postgres, the Redis stream bridge (`stream_bridge.type: redis`), `run_ownership.heartbeat_enabled: true`, and `run_events.backend: db`; process-local memory/JSONL event stores cannot enforce singleton delivery receipts across workers. The bridge shares SSE delivery and bounded `Last-Event-ID` replay across workers. When a valid reconnect cursor has been trimmed, or a subscriber that already established an empty-stream wait falls behind before its first delivery, Memory and Redis emit a machine-readable SSE `gap` event instead of silently returning a partial replay; the Web UI reloads durable thread/event state and resumes from the retained tail. Lease reconciliation marks runs from dead workers as errors, persists their delivery receipts, publishes the terminal stream marker, schedules retained-stream cleanup, and updates the affected thread status. SSE and `/wait` consumers also refresh durable status on heartbeats as a fallback if terminal publication fails. Malformed Redis reconnect IDs live-tail new events instead of replaying the retained buffer, and the rolling retained-buffer TTL (`stream_ttl_seconds`) remains a cleanup safety net rather than a run timeout. IM channel state and other process-local services still need their own multi-worker coordination.
>
> Run cancellation may land on any Gateway worker. A non-owning worker now persists the interrupt or rollback request for the live owner, which observes it during lease renewal and performs the normal cancellation flow; load-balancer routing alone no longer produces a 409. The first accepted action wins even if a retry lands on the owner, and accepted cancellation competes atomically with owner completion. Dead owners still follow lease takeover and orphan recovery. Cancellation latency is therefore bounded by the lease heartbeat interval.
>
> With lease heartbeat enabled, a transient RunStore renewal error is retried only until the last confirmed lease expires; the stale worker then cancels local execution and suppresses checkpoint, completion-hook, delivery-receipt, and thread-status finalization. A remote tool side effect already in flight may still be outside local cancellation.
>
> Reconciliation uses an atomic takeover claim that re-checks the lease after candidate selection, so a successful owner renewal wins over orphan recovery and only one reconciler can report a run as recovered. When multiple Gateway workers share the Docker/AIO or E2B sandbox backend, also configure `sandbox.ownership.type: redis`; E2B uses the leases during background startup and periodic reconciliation so duplicate/orphan cleanup cannot terminate a live peer's sandbox.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed Docker development guide.

#### Option 2: Local Development

If you prefer running services locally:

Prerequisite: complete the "Configuration" steps above first (`make setup`). `make dev` requires a valid `config.yaml` in the project root. Set `DEER_FLOW_PROJECT_ROOT` to define that root explicitly, or `DEER_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH` to point at a specific config file. Runtime state defaults to `.deer-flow` under the project root and can be moved with `DEER_FLOW_HOME`; skills default to `skills/` under the project root and can be moved with `DEER_FLOW_SKILLS_PATH`. Run `make doctor` to verify your setup before starting.
On Windows, run the local development flow from Git Bash. Native `cmd.exe` and PowerShell shells are not supported for the bash-based service scripts, and WSL is not guaranteed because some scripts rely on Git for Windows utilities such as `cygpath`.

1. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Verifies Node.js 22+, pnpm, uv, nginx
   ```

   The local `make check`, `make install`, `make dev`, and `make start` entry points use a direct `pnpm`/`pnpm.cmd` executable when available and otherwise fall back to `corepack pnpm`. The shared runner and diagnostics resolve repository paths absolutely, so these checks work regardless of the caller's current directory. Corepack runs from `frontend/`, so it honors the `packageManager` version pinned in `frontend/package.json`; enabling a global pnpm shim is not required.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make install  # Install backend + frontend dependencies + pre-commit hooks
   ```

3. **(Optional) Pre-pull sandbox image**:
   ```bash
   # Recommended if using Docker/Container-based sandbox
   make setup-sandbox
   ```

4. **(Optional) Load sample memory data for local review**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/load_memory_sample.py
   ```
   This copies the sample fixture into the default local runtime memory file so reviewers can immediately test `Settings > Memory`.
   See [backend/docs/MEMORY_SETTINGS_REVIEW.md](backend/docs/MEMORY_SETTINGS_REVIEW.md) for the shortest review flow.

5. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

6. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

Local services always use their internal ports (`8001`, `3000`, and `2026`).
The root `.env` variable `PORT` configures only the published Docker ingress;
it does not change the Next.js port used by `make dev`.

#### Startup Modes

DeerFlow runs the agent runtime inside the Gateway API. Development mode enables hot-reload; production mode uses a pre-built frontend.

| | **Local Foreground** | **Local Daemon** | **Docker Dev** | **Docker Prod** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev`<br/>`make dev` | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev --daemon`<br/>`make dev-daemon` | `./scripts/docker.sh start`<br/>`make docker-start` | — |
| **Prod** | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod`<br/>`make start` | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod --daemon`<br/>`make start-daemon` | — | `./scripts/deploy.sh`<br/>`make up` |

| Action | Local | Docker Dev | Docker Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stop** | `./scripts/serve.sh --stop`<br/>`make stop` | `./scripts/docker.sh stop`<br/>`make docker-stop` | `./scripts/deploy.sh down`<br/>`make down` |
| **Restart** | `./scripts/serve.sh --restart [flags]` | `./scripts/docker.sh restart` | — |

Gateway owns `/api/langgraph/*` and translates those public LangGraph-compatible paths to its native `/api/*` routers behind nginx.

#### LangGraph Studio (Optional)

The default `make dev` topology uses DeerFlow's Gateway-embedded runtime and
does not require LangGraph Studio. To inspect and test the registered lead-agent
graph with the standalone development server, run the command from `backend/`
so the CLI discovers `langgraph.json`:

```bash
cd backend
uv run langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

The command prints the local API and Studio UI URLs. This in-memory server is
for development and testing only. The flag permits DeerFlow's synchronous
configuration and graph-factory setup during local Studio requests; it must not
be treated as a production-server setting. Local Studio authentication is
handled automatically, so the connection does not require custom headers. Use
DeerFlow's documented production startup modes or a supported LangSmith
deployment for production workloads. Assistant ownership and provenance in this
standalone mode are server-owned: Studio can discover registered graphs and the
assistants it creates, and normal assistant-version selection remains available.
Before the locked local runtime loads its persisted development store, DeerFlow
repairs legacy assistant rows and version history so historical client metadata
cannot restore server privileges or be discarded by the runtime's startup
cleanup. Keep the backend dependencies synchronized with `uv sync`; this
compatibility path requires the declared LangGraph runtime versions and logs a
warning if the persisted-store contract no longer matches its expectations.
The documented command uses LangGraph's file-based custom-app loader, which is
also covered directly by DeerFlow's regression tests.

For workflows that invoke `backend/langgraph.json` through LangGraph Studio or
a direct LangGraph Server, DeerFlow consumes the authenticated identity
published by that runtime and uses it for custom-agent configuration/SOUL, user
skills and skill policy, uploads, thread data, and memory reads/writes. This
keeps authenticated runs out of the shared `default` filesystem bucket, and the
server-owned identity takes precedence over ordinary client-supplied `user_id`
values. External identities such as email addresses are mapped to stable,
collision-resistant directory-safe user IDs before accessing DeerFlow storage.
The default DeerFlow service topology remains the Gateway-embedded runtime
described above.

Gateway runs automatically enforce native delivery for artifacts created or modified under `/mnt/user-data/outputs`: `present_files` must present at least one output produced by the current run, and the terminal `run.delivery` receipt must be durably recorded. Virtual artifact paths are resolved within the same authenticated user and thread scope that produced the output before the output-directory boundary is validated. Runs that do not produce output artifacts keep ordinary conversational behavior.

DeerFlow's built-in custom events are available through both LangGraph streaming interfaces: native clients can continue subscribing to `stream_mode="custom"`, while callback-based integrations can consume the same payloads as `on_custom_event` records from `astream_events(version="v2")`. The callback event name matches the payload's `type` field.

#### Docker Production Deployment

`deploy.sh` supports building and starting separately:

```bash
# One-step (build + start)
deploy.sh

# Two-step (build once, start later)
deploy.sh build              # build all images
deploy.sh start              # start pre-built images

# Stop
deploy.sh down
```

### Advanced
#### Sandbox Mode

DeerFlow supports multiple sandbox execution modes:
- **Local Execution** (runs sandbox code directly on the host machine)
- **Docker Execution** (runs sandbox code in isolated Docker containers)
- **Docker Execution with Kubernetes** (runs sandbox code in Kubernetes pods via provisioner service)

For Docker development, service startup follows `config.yaml` sandbox mode. In Local/Docker modes, `provisioner` is not started.

See the [Sandbox Configuration Guide](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox) to configure your preferred mode.

#### MCP Server

DeerFlow supports configurable MCP servers and skills to extend its capabilities.
For HTTP/SSE MCP servers, OAuth token flows are supported (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`).
For stdio MCP servers, per-tool call timeouts can be configured with `tool_call_timeout`; durable background-task calls honor the same setting for HTTP/SSE servers as well.
MCP tool names are prefixed with `<server_name>_` by default to prevent collisions across servers. If a server already namespaces its own tools, set `tool_name_prefix: false` on that server in `extensions_config.json` to keep the original names. Disable the prefix only when the resulting names remain unique across all enabled servers.
Settings > Tools updates one MCP server at a time: an invalid stdio command on one server no longer blocks toggling another, while enabling that invalid server remains protected by the command allowlist and surfaces the backend validation message in the UI.
Targeted updates accept both DeerFlow's `type` field and the MCP-spec `transport` field for SSE/HTTP servers.
Runtime MCP and skill updates replace `extensions_config.json` atomically, so an interrupted write cannot leave the shared configuration truncated or partially written.
MCP routing hints can also prefer a specific MCP tool for matching requests without forbidding other tools. When `tool_search` defers MCP schemas, matching routing metadata can auto-promote up to `tool_search.auto_promote_top_k` deferred schemas before the model call.

OpenViking users can register the official Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp`
with an owner-bound USER API key. The native `forget` tool is exposed for
capability parity; deletion is irreversible, so it should be called only after
explicit user confirmation. DeerFlow does not enforce that confirmation. This
explicit, model-selected MCP tool path can run alongside the separate automatic
OpenViking memory backend; it does not replace automatic turn capture or recall. See the
[OpenViking MCP tools configuration](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md#openviking-mcp-tools).

The Gateway can adapt an MCP server's ordinary `submit` / `status` / `cancel` tools into durable background tasks. The Agent sees only the configured submit tool and a DeerFlow-local task ID; remote IDs are persisted before the submit call returns, while status and cancel stay internal to the runtime. Polling uses cross-worker leases, exponential retry backoff, scoped MCP sessions, bounded result storage, and restart recovery. A status-tool `isError` is retained as a bounded diagnostic and retried; servers report a permanent remote-task outcome through a normal structured result with `status: "failed"`. Remote poll hints are finite positive numbers capped at 24 hours, artifact-reference JSON is limited to 64 KiB, and task/server identifiers are validated against their durable SQL column limits before persistence. Input-required and terminal updates wake the current chat through idempotent Agent runs, while `list_background_tasks` and `cancel_background_task` let the Agent manage tasks without asking users for remote handles. Current-thread tasks are available through `GET /api/threads/{thread_id}/mcp-tasks`, its detail endpoint, and `POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/mcp-tasks/{task_id}/cancel`; when the task runtime actually starts, the Web UI exposes the same safe local view from the chat header with live status refresh, cancellation, and on-demand result, artifact, input-request, status-error, and cancellation-retry details. Default-disabled and memory-backend deployments hide that UI and do not poll the task endpoints. A failed remote cancellation remains queued with backoff, and its latest bounded error and attempt count stay visible in the expanded task card. Enable `mcp_tasks` in `config.yaml`, configure `task_toolsets` with exact raw tool names in `extensions_config.json`, and use a SQL database backend (`sqlite` or `postgres`). Task-enabled server connection, authentication, interceptor, timeout, or binding changes require a Gateway restart so Agent tool discovery and background calls cannot use different configuration versions. `input_required` is notification-only for now: DeerFlow can display the request but cannot yet submit the user's answer back to the remote task.

Notification launch and failed Agent-run deliveries use capped exponential backoff with a visible attempt count and stop after five failed attempts. A permanently rejected target such as a deleted chat is dead-lettered immediately instead of retried forever or recreated. Cancellation endpoints return after durably recording the request; the background service owns the potentially slow remote MCP call and its retry schedule.

Notification runs keep their trusted delivery instruction separate from the framed, untrusted remote event payload. The process-started task runtime—not a hot config read—controls whether the task-management tools are exposed, so changing `mcp_tasks` requires a Gateway restart. When a skill's `allowed-tools` policy is active, `list_background_tasks` and `cancel_background_task` must be declared explicitly like other business tools.
See the [MCP Server Guide](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for detailed instructions.

Security: pass per-request MCP credentials only through `config.context.secrets`;
credentials must never be placed in either run metadata surface
(`metadata.auth_token` or `config.metadata.auth_token`). See [MCP credential migration and cleanup](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md#migrating-legacy-mcp-credentials)
for the supported interceptor flow and the required rotation and retained-copy
cleanup when migrating from legacy metadata credentials.

#### IM Channels

DeerFlow supports receiving tasks from messaging apps. Channels auto-start when configured — no public IP required for any of them.

DeerFlow can also expose user-owned IM channel connections in the workspace UI. When `channel_connections` is enabled, logged-in users can bind Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, WeCom, or Buzz from the sidebar / Settings > Channels. It reuses the existing outbound `channels.*` transports, so no public IP or provider callback URL is required. Incoming IM messages then run under the connected DeerFlow user account. See [IM Channel Connections](backend/docs/IM_CHANNEL_CONNECTIONS.md) for setup and security notes.

| Channel | Transport | Difficulty |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Telegram | Bot API (long-polling) | Easy |
| Slack | Socket Mode | Moderate |
| Feishu / Lark | WebSocket | Moderate |
| WeChat | Tencent iLink (long-polling) | Moderate |
| WeCom | WebSocket | Moderate |
| DingTalk | Stream Push (WebSocket) | Moderate |
| Buzz | Nostr relay (WebSocket, NIP-42) | Moderate |

    card_template_id: ""                       # Optional: AI Card template ID for streaming typewriter effect
```

Notes:
- `assistant_id: lead_agent` calls the default LangGraph assistant directly.
- If `assistant_id` is set to a custom agent name, DeerFlow still routes through `lead_agent` and injects that value as `agent_name`, so the custom agent's SOUL/config takes effect for IM channels.
- IM channel workers call Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API internally and automatically attach process-local internal auth plus the CSRF cookie/header pair required for thread and run creation.
- Inbound work is bounded to `inbound_queue_maxsize` pending messages plus `max_concurrency` active workers. When capacity is exhausted, socket/polling providers drop new messages before sending DeerFlow's working acknowledgment and emit a rate-limited warning. Buzz leaves its replay cursor unchanged and reconnects for relay replay; GitHub webhooks return `503`, marking the delivery failed for manual/API redelivery. Shutdown closes admission immediately, keeps channel transports available while accepted messages drain for up to `shutdown_grace_period_seconds`, then cancels and awaits active handlers before closing provider resources; the Gateway's outer timeout can cancel an incomplete shutdown without detaching those resources.
- Feishu/Lark now queues rapid follow-up messages per mapped DeerFlow `thread_id` instead of immediately surfacing the generic busy reply, and topic replies keep a per-message card with a compact source-message preview across queued/running/final patches.

Set the corresponding API keys in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Telegram
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ

# Slack
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...

# Feishu / Lark
FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxxx
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret

# WeChat iLink
WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN=your_ilink_bot_token
WECHAT_ILINK_BOT_ID=your_ilink_bot_id

# WeCom
WECOM_BOT_ID=your_bot_id
WECOM_BOT_SECRET=your_bot_secret

# DingTalk
DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

**Telegram Setup**

1. Chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, and copy the HTTP API token.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.
3. The bot accepts inbound text, photos, and documents (with or without captions). Hosted Bot API downloads are limited to 20 MB per attachment.

**Slack Setup**

1. Create a Slack App at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → Create New App → From scratch.
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add Bot Token Scopes: `app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `files:write`.
3. Enable **Socket Mode** → generate an App-Level Token (`xapp-…`) with `connections:write` scope.
4. Under **Event Subscriptions**, subscribe to bot events: `app_mention`, `message.im`.
5. Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.

**Feishu / Lark Setup**

1. Create an app on [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) → enable **Bot** capability.
2. Add permissions: `im:message`, `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly`, `im:resource`.
3. Under **Events**, subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1` and select **Long Connection** mode.
4. Copy the App ID and App Secret. Set `FEISHU_APP_ID` and `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` in `.env` and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.
5. The bot supports inbound text, image, and file messages. Inbound attachment downloads are limited to 20 MB per attachment.

**WeChat Setup**

1. Enable the `wechat` channel in `config.yaml`.
2. Either set `WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`, or set `qrcode_login_enabled: true` for first-time QR bootstrap.
3. When `bot_token` is absent and QR bootstrap is enabled, watch backend logs for the QR content returned by iLink and complete the binding flow.
4. After the QR flow succeeds, DeerFlow persists the acquired token under `state_dir` for later restarts.
5. For Docker Compose deployments, keep `state_dir` on a persistent volume so the `get_updates_buf` cursor and saved auth state survive restarts.

**WeCom Setup**

1. Create a bot on the WeCom AI Bot platform and obtain the `bot_id` and `bot_secret`.
2. Enable `channels.wecom` in `config.yaml` and fill in `bot_id` / `bot_secret`.
3. Set `WECOM_BOT_ID` and `WECOM_BOT_SECRET` in `.env`.
4. Make sure backend dependencies include `wecom-aibot-python-sdk`. The channel uses a WebSocket long connection and does not require a public callback URL.
5. The current integration supports inbound text, image, and file messages. Final images/files generated by the agent are also sent back to the WeCom conversation.

**DingTalk Setup**

1. Create a DingTalk application in the [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open.dingtalk.com/) and enable **Robot** capability.
2. Set the message receiving mode to **Stream Mode** in the robot configuration page.
3. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, set `DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID` and `DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`, and enable the channel in `config.yaml`.
4. *(Optional)* To enable streaming AI Card replies (typewriter effect), create an **AI Card** template on the [DingTalk Card Platform](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/dingstart/typewriter-effect-streaming-ai-card), then set `card_template_id` in `config.yaml` to the template ID. You also need to apply for the `Card.Streaming.Write` and `Card.Instance.Write` permissions.


When DeerFlow runs in Docker Compose, IM channels execute inside the `gateway` container. In that case, do not point `channels.langgraph_url` or `channels.gateway_url` at `localhost`; use container service names such as `http://gateway:8001/api` and `http://gateway:8001`, or set `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_LANGGRAPH_URL` and `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_GATEWAY_URL`.

**Commands**

Once a channel is connected, you can interact with DeerFlow directly from the chat:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/status` | Show current thread info |
| `/models` | List available models |
| `/memory` | View memory |
| `/help` | Show help |

> Messages without a command prefix are treated as regular chat — DeerFlow creates a thread and responds conversationally.

#### Request Trace Correlation

Gateway request trace correlation is disabled by default so existing HTTP responses and log formats stay unchanged. To enable it, set:

```yaml
logging:
  enhance:
    enabled: true
    format: text
```

When enabled, every Gateway HTTP response includes `X-Trace-Id`, logs include `trace_id`, and Langfuse traces created by that request include `metadata.deerflow_trace_id` with the same value.

Gateway run history also records one terminal `run.delivery` receipt per run,
including zero-output and crash-recovered runs. The receipt is persisted before
the durable terminal run status during normal execution. Orphan recovery first
atomically claims an expired lease and then idempotently backfills the receipt,
so a stale recovery scan cannot overwrite a live run's detailed delivery facts.
Receipt persistence remains best-effort during an event-store outage. Runs that
fail checkpoint preflight (or are cancelled while waiting for prior
finalization) keep the existing completion-data behavior: they receive the
zero-delivery receipt but do not overwrite RunStore completion fields with an
empty snapshot.

#### LangSmith Tracing

DeerFlow has built-in [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) integration for observability. When enabled, all LLM calls, agent runs, and tool executions are traced and visible in the LangSmith dashboard.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=xxx
```

#### Langfuse Tracing

DeerFlow also supports [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) observability for LangChain-compatible runs.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
LANGFUSE_TRACING=true
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, set `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` to your deployment URL.

**Trace correlation fields.** Every agent run is annotated with Langfuse's reserved trace attributes so the Sessions and Users pages light up automatically:

- `session_id` = LangGraph `thread_id` — groups every trace of the same conversation
- `user_id` = effective user from `get_effective_user_id()` (falls back to `default` in no-auth mode)
- `trace_name` = assistant id (defaults to `lead-agent`)
- `tags` = `[env:<DEER_FLOW_ENV>, model:<model_name>]` (omitted when not set)
- `metadata.deerflow_trace_id` = DeerFlow request correlation id, matching `X-Trace-Id` when request trace correlation is enabled

These are injected into `RunnableConfig.metadata` at the graph invocation root for both the gateway path (`runtime/runs/worker.py::run_agent`) and the embedded path (`client.py::DeerFlowClient.stream`), so any LangChain-compatible callback can read them. Set `DEER_FLOW_ENV` (or `ENVIRONMENT`) to tag traces by deployment environment.

#### Monocle Tracing

DeerFlow also supports [Monocle](https://github.com/monocle2ai/monocle), an OpenTelemetry-based tracer for agentic applications. It records each run end-to-end: LLM calls, agent steps, and tool and MCP invocations, with their inputs, outputs, timings, and token counts.

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
MONOCLE_TRACING=true
MONOCLE_EXPORTERS=file          # file, console, okahu, s3, blob, gcs (default: file)
OKAHU_API_KEY=okh_xxxxxxxx      # required only for the `okahu` exporter
```

Each run writes one trace file to `.monocle/`; open it in the [Monocle VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OkahuAI.monocle-apptrace) to inspect the span timeline and token counts. Connect to [Okahu](https://www.okahu.ai), an agent-observability platform, to analyze traces across runs and run trace-based and agentic evaluations (via the `okahu` exporter).

Traces capture span inputs and outputs verbatim — prompts, tool arguments, and model responses — plus token usage and timings. The `file` exporter keeps them on local disk and never rotates or cleans them up, so prune `.monocle/` periodically; the remote exporters (`okahu`, `s3`, `blob`, `gcs`) send that same data off-box, so enable only destinations you trust. Monocle is initialized once at Gateway startup: a configuration error (unknown exporter, missing `OKAHU_API_KEY`) is logged there and tracing stays off until the Gateway restarts.

#### Using Multiple Providers

LangSmith and Langfuse attach as LangChain callbacks, so you can enable both and DeerFlow reports each run to both. If an enabled provider is missing required credentials or fails to initialize, DeerFlow fails fast and names it. Monocle uses a global OpenTelemetry provider rather than a callback; Langfuse shares that provider, so all three can run together. Because both span processors sit on the same shared provider, Monocle's exporters also see Langfuse's spans when both are enabled.

For Docker deployments, tracing is disabled by default. Set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in your `.env` to enable it.

## From Deep Research to Super Agent Harness

DeerFlow started as a Deep Research framework — and the community ran with it. Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.

That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn't just a research tool. It was a **harness** — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.

So we rebuilt it from scratch.

DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It's a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandbox-aware execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.

Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.

## Core Features

### Skills & Tools

Skills are what make DeerFlow do *almost anything*.

A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.

Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.

A skill directory is a package boundary: once DeerFlow finds its `SKILL.md`, nested `SKILL.md` files under that package (for example evaluation fixtures) remain supporting data and are not registered as runtime skills. Namespace directories without their own `SKILL.md` can still group nested skills.

Users can explicitly activate an enabled skill for a single turn by starting the request with `/skill-name`, for example `/data-analysis analyze uploads/foo.csv`. DeerFlow loads that skill's `SKILL.md` as hidden current-turn context while leaving the base prompt limited to skill metadata. Slash activation respects disabled skills, custom-agent skill whitelists, and existing channel commands such as `/new` and `/help`.

An enabled skill's `allowed-tools` policy applies only after that skill is explicitly slash-activated or captured in the agent's active skill context after a `read_file` load. Merely enabling, advertising, or listing a skill in a custom agent or subagent `skills` allowlist does not reduce that agent's normal toolset; subagents use the same progressive discovery and activation policy as the lead agent. During a slash-activated run, that explicit skill's policy is authoritative: reading another `SKILL.md` may provide instructions but cannot widen the slash skill's tools. Without slash activation, policies from skills actually loaded into active context retain their union semantics. Once active, the policy filters both model-visible tool schemas and tool execution. Framework discovery tools (`tool_search` and `describe_skill`) remain available so an allowed deferred tool or installed skill can still be discovered, but discovery and promotion never grant permission to execute a business tool omitted from `allowed-tools`. `task` is not framework-exempt; a restrictive skill must list it explicitly to delegate to a subagent. Per-step policy decisions are internal runtime context and are removed from observable or persisted context copies. Registry failures and an active set with no remaining valid skill fail closed to framework-safe tools; individual stale paths are ignored only when another valid active skill remains. This is best-effort behavioral scoping, not a hard security boundary: loading skill instructions through another tool is not captured, and active-skill entries can be evicted from bounded context.

When you install `.skill` archives through the Gateway, DeerFlow accepts standard optional frontmatter metadata such as `version`, `author`, and `compatibility` instead of rejecting otherwise valid external skills.

Disabling a skill also removes it from the sandbox filesystem view, so shell commands and structured file tools follow the same enabled state. Local, Docker/AIO, hostPath provisioner, and newly created E2B sandboxes source `/mnt/skills` from enabled-only projections that update when public, custom, legacy, or managed integration skills are toggled, edited, created, deleted, or installed. Structured `read_file` calls (including line ranges and read-before-write checks) use the sandbox provider's mount mapping, so the user identity captured when the sandbox was acquired remains authoritative. Managed integration packages remain shared, while their projected filesystem visibility follows each user's enabled state. Multi-worker Gateways re-read on-disk enable state while rebuilding user projections, so a toggle handled by one worker is honored by another worker's next sandbox acquire. Existing E2B sandboxes retain their creation-time snapshot until they are recreated. PVC-backed provisioner skills keep their configured PVC snapshot/layout for now; dynamic PVC materialization is tracked separately.

Managed integrations install shared read-only skill packs without mixing them
into custom skills. The Lark/Feishu CLI integration is available under
`Settings → Integrations → Lark / Feishu CLI`; an administrator installs or
upgrades the official `lark-*` pack once under
`{DEER_FLOW_HOME}/integrations/skills/lark-cli`, and every user discovers that
same pack with an independent enabled state. Each user's app configuration and
OAuth data remain isolated under
`{DEER_FLOW_HOME}/users/{user_id}/integrations/lark-cli/{config,data}`. These
secret directories are restricted to `0700`, regular credential files to
`0600`, and symlinks are rejected.

After installation, users can click **Connect Lark** to open a browser
authorization link; no terminal authorization is required. The same UI can
request additional permission domains such as Calendar, Docs, or Drive, or a
specific OAuth scope reported by `lark-cli`. A cheap status refresh only
inspects the local credential tree, so the UI reports **Credentials configured
(not live-verified)** until an explicit browser completion performs live token
verification. The action then remains **Reconnect Lark** so users can replace
or extend authorization. If an agent hits missing Lark authorization during a
conversation, the managed `lark-shared` guidance points the user back to the
same settings entry with `?settings=integrations`.

Once configured, **Change Lark app** lets a user point their DeerFlow account at
a different Lark/Feishu app without a reinstall — either by pasting an existing
app's App ID / App Secret or by re-registering an app in the browser. Switching
is per-user (it never touches another user's credentials), validates the new
credentials through the official CLI's live tenant-token probe before replacing
the active app, and revokes/removes the previous app's OAuth tokens. A rejected
credential change does not supersede an in-progress setup or authorization flow.
DeerFlow then immediately opens browser authorization for the newly bound app so
the switch ends in a usable connection.

Installing the Lark skill pack resolves the latest official `larksuite/cli`
release from GitHub and downloads that version's skills at install time, so the
Gateway needs outbound internet access for that step (it falls back to a
bottom-line pinned version if the release lookup fails). The settings page shows
the installed version and, when available, the newest published version so an
admin can reinstall to upgrade. Air-gapped deployments can pre-stage the archive
and point `DEER_FLOW_LARK_CLI_SKILLS_ARCHIVE` at the local file. Integrity does
not depend on a pinned archive byte hash (GitHub does not guarantee stable
source-archive bytes); instead the download is restricted to the official GitHub
host, every archive member passes structural safety guards, and a content hash
of the effective installed skill tree (including DeerFlow's injected shared
guidance) is recorded so content changes are auditable across reinstalls.

When `sandbox.use` selects the AIO provider, the same install also downloads the
official Linux amd64 and arm64 CLI release archives, verifies their published
SHA-256 checksums, safely extracts one executable per architecture, and mounts
the resulting runtime read-only at `/mnt/integrations/lark-cli/runtime`. An
architecture-selecting launcher in that mount makes `lark-cli` available in the
sandbox `PATH`. Air-gapped AIO deployments can pre-stage a symlink-free runtime
tree containing `bin/lark-cli` plus both `linux-{amd64,arm64}/lark-cli` files and
set `DEER_FLOW_LARK_CLI_SANDBOX_RUNTIME_DIR` to that directory.

> **Sandbox trust boundary:** the browser never receives the Lark app secret, but
> agent conversations run `lark-cli` inside the sandbox, so the per-user
> credential directories are mounted into it: `config` (holding the long-lived
> `appSecret`) is mounted **read-only**, its otherwise empty `config/locks`
> subdirectory is over-mounted writable for `lark-cli` coordination files, and
> `data` (refreshable OAuth tokens) is writable. The credential-bearing config
> and data mounts remain *readable* by any process the agent runs there, so code
> reached via prompt injection in a tool result could read them. Treat the
> sandbox as inside the Lark credential trust boundary until the sidecar
> credential-broker follow-up removes these mounts from sandbox execution.

For remote/Kubernetes deployments (the provisioner backend), the sandbox
`lark-cli` runtime can instead be supplied by an optional init container that
copies the binaries into a shared `emptyDir` — no install-time GitHub download and
no hostPath/PVC runtime mount. Publish the image under
[`docker/lark-cli-init`](docker/lark-cli-init/README.md) and set
`LARK_CLI_INIT_IMAGE` on the provisioner; it stays off (legacy behavior) when
unset. The Lark integration status (`GET /api/integrations/lark/status`) reports
`sandbox_runtime_mode` and `sandbox_runtime_ready` so the Settings UI shows
whether `lark-cli` will actually be present in the sandbox at chat time, rather
than a green status hiding a later `command not found`.

If a trusted operator manages the configured skills directory through an external mount such as MinIO, NFS, or CSI, an administrator can call `POST /api/skills/reload` after changing files. This invalidates skill prompt caches for the current Gateway process and waits up to the bounded refresh timeout so subsequent runs rescan the latest files; running tasks are unchanged. A loader-level filesystem failure returns a generic server error and preserves the last successfully loaded process cache rather than publishing an empty catalog. Uvicorn workers and Kubernetes Pods must each be targeted separately. Direct mount writes bypass the validation, SkillScan, and history applied by DeerFlow's install/edit APIs, so only operator-controlled systems should have write access.

Skill installs and agent-managed skill edits run through **SkillScan**, a native deterministic safety scanner before the LLM-based skill scanner. Phase 1 runs offline with no Semgrep/OpenGrep dependency, blocks high-confidence `CRITICAL` findings such as private keys or shell execution, and passes warning findings to the LLM scanner for contextual review. The moderation adapter normalizes both plain-text model responses and LangChain Responses API text blocks before parsing the required JSON decision. Python instance-client exfiltration checks follow a minimal same-scope evidence chain: a simple name bound to a known client constructor, optional name-to-name aliases, and an actual outbound method or context-manager use supported by that constructor. Constructor roots must be proven imports; bare canonical-looking names are not inferred as modules. Nested scopes do not inherit client handles and inherit only constructor import aliases that are never rebound in the enclosing scope. Comprehensions, walrus-bearing statements, annotations, complex binding targets, unsupported operations, and ambiguous branch flows produce no finding from this signal; skipped constructs conservatively invalidate every name they may bind so stale client state cannot create a finding. A deterministic work budget or recursion limit reached by this best-effort analysis does not discard findings already collected for the file. Set `skill_scan.enabled: false` in `config.yaml` to disable only the deterministic analyzers; safe archive extraction and the LLM scanner still run.

DeerFlow also ships with **skill-reviewer**, a public skill for read-only skill quality review. It uses the built-in `review_skill_package` tool to inspect installed skills, local packages, archives, or pasted `SKILL.md` content without activating the target skill, binding its secrets, executing its scripts, or installing it. The tool returns a compact, tag-neutralized JSON payload to the model context and keeps the full raw review payload in the tool artifact for programmatic consumers. The deterministic review core reuses DeerFlow parsing and SkillScan facts, emits versioned JSON contracts under `contracts/skill_review/`, and can be run from the backend CLI:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -m deerflow.skills.review.cli ../skills/public/data-analysis --format text --fail-on error --fail-on-incomplete
```

Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, rendered web capture, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.

Advanced deployments can enable pluggable authorization with `authorization.enabled` in `config.yaml`. A configured `AuthorizationProvider` filters denied tools before they reach the model or deferred-tool catalog, then the same provider is checked again before every business-tool execution through the existing guardrail middleware. Gateway `threads:*` and `runs:*` route permissions are derived from the same provider, while existing owner checks and admin-only management gates remain in force. A generated `tool_search` may bypass the second tool check only when it fronts the current build's already-filtered deferred catalog. Model access follows the same provider: the Gateway `models` list is filtered per principal, `model:use` is enforced on model detail requests and again when the runtime resolves the agent's model, and a denied default model falls back to the first remaining candidate that also passes `model:use`. The built-in RBAC provider supports per-role `tools`, `routes`, `models`, `skills`, and `sandbox` allow/deny policies and validates that `default_role` names a configured role; authorization is disabled by default. See `config.example.yaml` and the [authorization RFC](docs/plans/2026-07-10-pluggable-authorization-rfc.md).

Advanced deployments can also extend the agent runtime itself by declaring zero-argument `AgentMiddleware` classes under `extensions.middlewares` in `config.yaml` or `extensions_config.json`. DeerFlow loads the same configured class list into the lead-agent and subagent pipelines after their built-in runtime middlewares and loop/token guards, but before the terminal-response/safety/clarification tail, so enterprise forks can add domain guardrails, tool-call governance, or observability hooks without patching the built-in middleware builders. Missing packages, invalid classes, and broken modules fail loudly at agent creation. Treat `config.yaml` and `extensions_config.json` as trusted operator-controlled files: middleware paths are code execution, just like custom tool, model, sandbox, guardrail, MCP server, and MCP interceptor declarations. Gateway skill/MCP toggle endpoints preserve this field but do not expose an API write path for `extensions.middlewares`. Per-context parameterization and separate lead-only/subagent-only middleware lists are not supported yet.

For packaged and configurable runtime integrations, use DeerFlow's extension manager.
It accepts a Python package requirement, a public HTTPS Git URL, or a local directory, installs the
package into the backend's dedicated `extensions` dependency group, updates
`backend/uv.lock`, and adds an enabled entry to the startup-only top-level `plugins:` list
in `config.yaml`:

```bash
# PyPI — pin a version for a reproducible deployment
make extension-install SOURCE="deerflow-extension-acme==1.2.3"

# Public HTTPS Git — pin an immutable commit
make extension-install \
  SOURCE="git+https://github.com/acme/deerflow-extension-acme.git@0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"

# Local package — an absolute path avoids Make's backend-relative working directory
make extension-install SOURCE="$PWD/examples/deerflow-extension-example"

make extension-list
make extension-disable NAME=acme
make extension-enable NAME=acme
make extension-remove NAME=acme
```

Installation is interactive because package installation can execute Python build hooks,
and the loaded extension later runs with Gateway privileges. For an already-reviewed
source, automation can acknowledge that boundary explicitly with
`cd backend && uv run --frozen --no-group extensions deerflow extensions install <source> --yes`.
The manager requires uv 0.8.0 or newer; the provided Docker images pin uv 0.11.1.
The other direct
commands are `deerflow extensions list`, `enable NAME`, `disable NAME`, and `remove NAME`;
`NAME` may be the extension name, Python distribution, or `module:install` value. Do not
put credentials in a source URL — a URL carrying embedded userinfo or a credential-looking
query parameter is rejected before uv runs. Remote Git sources must use public HTTPS; SSH
Git URLs are rejected because the stock Docker builder does not forward host SSH
credentials. Installing from a loopback URL is allowed for local tooling but warns, because
`127.0.0.1` recorded in the lock is a different machine inside the Docker builder.

A managed package declares exactly one standard PEP 621 entry point:

```toml
[project.entry-points."deerflow.extensions"]
acme = "acme_deerflow_extension:install"
```

That callable uses the standalone `deerflow-extension-api` contract and can register five
contribution kinds: isolated middleware at semantic lead/subagent model or tool positions,
lead and subagent task-lifecycle hooks, observers for DeerFlow-owned model calls that are
not wrapped by middleware model-call hooks (goal, memory, title, and summarization),
Gateway-lifetime services, and eager FastAPI HTTP routers. The contract package has no
framework dependencies; extensions must declare FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, or other
libraries they import.

DeerFlow allocates a task-scoped extension store only for middleware, lifecycle, or
system-model observation. Services receive app-scoped runtime dependencies after Gateway
persistence is ready and stop in reverse order after active runs drain. Extension HTTP
routers are mounted after every host route; definite shadows and routes entering the
host's authentication- or CSRF-exempt paths are rejected with attributed diagnostics,
while unrelated routers continue to load. Because the host's public paths are a reserved
prefix list that extensions cannot enter, **every contributed endpoint requires an
authenticated session** — there is currently no way for an extension to expose an
unauthenticated route, so inbound provider webhooks and public status endpoints are out of
scope for this release. Within that, an extension distinguishes an ordinary user from an
administrator through `deerflow_extension_api.auth`: `resolve_principal(request)` returns
the caller, `require_admin(request)` raises `PermissionError` for anyone else and fails
closed when identity cannot be determined. Extensions receive a projection — user id, admin
flag, internal flag, roles — never the host's auth context. Router startup/shutdown hooks,
custom lifespans, Mounts, and WebSocket routes are not accepted; lifetime resources belong in
`ExtensionService`, and WebSocket contributions require a future host-owned
authentication/Origin wrapper. Lifecycle and system-model callbacks use the Gateway's
canonical notification loop, including subagents on isolated loops.
Plugin order is deterministic, per-plugin configuration is passed to `install()`, and
`required: true` makes load failure abort startup; otherwise failures are reported and
skipped. `enabled: false` skips resolution and import. The manager preserves the extension's
private `config` when toggling it and writes `name`, `package`, `use`, `enabled`, and
`required` metadata for managed installs. Installs are recorded `required: false` so a
later broken extension is reported rather than blocking Gateway startup; pass
`extensions install <source> --required` when the package's absence should abort startup
instead. Plugins load once when the Gateway app is
constructed, so install, enable, disable, remove, and manual `plugins:` edits all require a
Gateway restart. Because this imports Python code, `plugins:` is intentionally unavailable
through the API-writable `extensions_config.json`.

Management commands bootstrap the checkout environment without the extension group via
`uv run --frozen --no-group extensions`. Frozen mode lets `disable` and `remove` start even
when an installed extension's remote source or managed snapshot has become unavailable,
while a fresh checkout can still create the non-extension environment from the existing lock. The
manager itself owns the subsequent locked dependency transaction.
Mutations for one checkout are serialized through a process lock. The initial manager
surface is create/remove rather than in-place upgrade: to change an installed source, save
its private `plugins[].config`, remove it, reinstall the new pin, and restore that config.

Local-directory installs are copied into
`backend/extensions/sources/<normalized-distribution>/`; this deployable snapshot, rather
than the original directory, is recorded in the lock. Git metadata, virtual environments,
bytecode caches, symbolic links, and likely credential files are not accepted as snapshot
content. Review what you install anyway: filtering accidental files does not sandbox an
extension, its build backend, or its runtime code.

Local `make dev`/`make start`, Docker development, and the production Gateway image all
consume the same `backend/pyproject.toml` and `backend/uv.lock`. Local and Docker-dev
launchers perform a locked sync before starting; the production image performs that sync
during its build and includes managed local snapshots in the build context. Gateway runtime
commands then use the already-created environment without resolving or installing packages.
Local and Docker-development pre-start syncs may download missing locked artifacts. A
production deployment instead downloads them only during the explicit install or image
build; starting the resulting production Gateway container never resolves or installs
extensions from the network. A local wheel or `file://` Git URL is rejected because it
would not exist in the Docker build context; pass a source directory to create a managed
snapshot instead. Because environment configuration (such as a `UV_FIND_LINKS` wheelhouse)
can still resolve a plain package name to a local wheel, the manager audits every new lock
before enabling the extension: any local reference the stock image build cannot reproduce
rolls back the entire install or removal.
Rebuild with `make up` after changing the managed extension set. See
`config.example.yaml` and the
[reference extension](examples/deerflow-extension-example/) for a complete example.

Gateway-generated follow-up suggestions now normalize both plain-string model output and block/list-style rich content before parsing the JSON array response, so provider-specific content wrappers do not silently drop suggestions.

The Web UI composer can polish draft input before sending. The rewrite runs as a short Gateway LLM request using the `input_polish` model configuration, keeps slash skill prefixes such as `/data-analysis`, and only replaces the local draft after the user clicks the polish button; it does not create a thread run or persist a message.

When the agent asks for clarification, the Web UI shows the structured response card but keeps the normal composer available. Users can complete the card or send a free-form chat message to bypass it; that message closes the latest pending clarification and becomes the agent's next input.

Unsent Web UI composer drafts survive page reloads and switching between conversations within the same browser tab. Drafts are isolated by user, agent, and conversation, include a selected slash skill when present, and are cleared once a send is accepted. Attachments and quoted conversation context are intentionally not persisted.

The Web UI composer also supports browser-based voice dictation when the browser exposes the Web Speech API. The microphone button transcribes speech into the local draft only; DeerFlow receives only the transcribed text, while audio handling is delegated to the browser or operating system speech-recognition service according to that environment's policy. Users can review or edit the text before sending.

The Web UI displays a localized AI-generated-content disclaimer below the composer in both standard and custom-agent conversations, reminding users to verify important
information.

Interrupted first-turn runs still persist a fallback conversation title, so stopping a streaming response does not leave the thread as "Untitled" after refresh.

Streaming Markdown responses animate only newly arrived words; text that is already visible is not faded out and replayed when the next chunk extends the same block.

In the Web UI, completed assistant turns can be branched into a new main conversation. Automatically inherited branch titles use the next free language-neutral numeric suffix (`Title (2)`, then `Title (3)` for another sibling or a branch of the numbered conversation) so generated sibling titles remain distinct without persisting a locale-specific label; matching explicit or renamed sibling titles also reserve their displayed suffix even though they carry no generated sequence metadata. An explicit API title is preserved. Renaming a branch clears its generated sequence, so its next automatic branch starts from the renamed title at `(2)`. Recent chats also groups loaded branches directly beneath a loaded parent with subtle tree connectors. Missing parents, malformed or cyclic lineage, and branches in a different pinned state stay visible at the top level instead of being hidden or moved across the pinned boundary. The new thread starts from that turn's checkpoint and keeps the preceding replay checkpoint, so the branched response can be regenerated immediately. The latest response can also be regenerated after an interruption, even when its streamed partial text never reached a checkpoint. Regenerating the latest response preserves the thread's current title, including a title you renamed manually after the original response. Legacy or imported histories without checkpoint parent links use a bounded chronological fallback; if no earlier replay checkpoint exists, branching still succeeds with the legacy single-checkpoint shape, while regeneration remains unavailable for that inherited response. Existing single-checkpoint branches are left unchanged rather than attempting an unsafe checkpoint copy. Because workspace files are not checkpointed, the branch only receives a best-effort copy of the current workspace when you branch from the latest turn; branching from an older turn keeps just the restored message history so the branch never inherits files that were created in a later part of the conversation.

The Web UI reports completed task time once per run. This is total wall-clock time—including model reasoning, tool calls, and waiting—not a per-step or model-only thinking duration. Reasoning content remains available through its own separate disclosure.

In the Web UI, the latest completed user turn can also be edited and rerun from the message toolbar. DeerFlow restores the conversation checkpoint before that user message, submits the edited text as a new user message, and hides the superseded turn once the replay is in progress or succeeds. This is a conversation-state replay only: files, memory updates, and external tool side effects are not undone.

Web UI chat links percent-encode custom thread identifiers before placing them in route segments, so reserved URL characters such as `#` and `?` do not change which conversation is opened.

#### Claude Code Integration

The `claude-to-deerflow` skill lets you interact with a running DeerFlow instance directly from [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Send research tasks, check status, manage threads — all without leaving the terminal.

**Install the skill**:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow --skill claude-to-deerflow
```

Then make sure DeerFlow is running (default at `http://localhost:2026`) and use the `/claude-to-deerflow` command in Claude Code.

**What you can do**:
- Send messages to DeerFlow and get streaming responses
- Choose execution modes: flash (fast), standard, pro (planning), ultra (sub-agents)
- Check DeerFlow health, list models/skills/agents
- Manage threads and conversation history
- Upload files for analysis

**Environment variables** (optional, for custom endpoints):

```bash
DEERFLOW_URL=http://localhost:2026            # Unified proxy base URL
DEERFLOW_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:2026    # Gateway API
DEERFLOW_LANGGRAPH_URL=http://localhost:2026/api/langgraph  # LangGraph API
```

See [`skills/public/claude-to-deerflow/SKILL.md`](skills/public/claude-to-deerflow/SKILL.md) for the full API reference.

### Session Goals

Use `/goal <completion condition>` to attach one active completion condition to the current thread. The goal is thread-scoped state, not a skill activation, so it stays active across turns until DeerFlow determines it has been satisfied or you clear it.

Supported commands:

```text
/goal finish the implementation and make all tests pass
/goal              # show the active goal
/goal clear        # clear it
```

After each Gateway-backed run, DeerFlow evaluates the visible conversation against the active goal with a non-thinking evaluator model. The evaluator must return a typed blocker (`missing_evidence`, `needs_user_input`, `run_failed`, `external_wait`, or `goal_not_met_yet`) plus visible evidence. DeerFlow only injects a hidden continuation when the latest assistant turn is durably checkpointed, the blocker is `goal_not_met_yet`, the thread did not change during evaluation, and the no-progress breaker has not fired. The safety cap defaults to 8 hidden continuations, and repeated identical non-progress evaluations stop after 2 attempts. `/goal clear` and any user-authored new input win over queued continuations. When the goal is satisfied, DeerFlow clears it automatically and publishes the updated thread state.

The Web UI shows the active goal above the composer. The same command is available from the TUI and supported IM channels. In the Web UI and supported IM channels, setting `/goal <completion condition>` also starts a run with the condition as the task; status and clear commands only manage goal state. Setting or clearing a goal is rejected while that thread has a run in flight, including a run owned by another Gateway worker, so the goal checkpoint cannot branch away from an active run's checkpoint lineage.

### Manual Context Compaction

Use `/compact` in the Web UI composer to summarize older context for the current thread. DeerFlow keeps the full chat visible, but future model calls use the compacted summary plus recent messages. The command is ignored when there is not enough history to compact, and it is blocked while the thread has a run in flight, including when that run is owned by another Gateway worker. If a multi-worker reservation loses its lease, DeerFlow cancels the checkpoint writer before the replacing run proceeds and returns a retryable conflict after cleanup. Thread-title edits are serialized through the same state-write boundary and show a conflict without closing the rename dialog when a run is active.

The chat header also shows a context-window gauge when the selected model has a positive `context_window` configured. It estimates the latest materialized checkpoint's message tokens and keeps the previous same-thread percentage visible while data refetches, independently of the cumulative token-usage setting.

### Sub-Agents

Sub-agents are an optimization, not the default response to a complex request.

The lead agent can spawn sub-agents on the fly — each with its own scoped context, tools, and termination conditions — when delegation has clear net benefit from real parallel latency, specialist capability, or context isolation. It keeps interdependent scopes and overlapping side effects out of parallel dispatch; a bounded sequential chain can still run in one sub-agent when specialist or context-isolation benefit clearly wins. The lead uses the fewest useful sub-agents and re-evaluates later batches instead of fanning out solely because a task is large or multi-step. Sub-agents report back structured results, and the lead agent verifies and synthesizes them into a coherent output. Deterministic tool receipts cover both direct tool messages and state-updating `Command` results such as delegated `task` responses; when the receipt ledger reaches its context budget, it retains the newest actions and their original receipt IDs. Operators can disable this provenance layer with `verification.receipts_enabled: false`. Their configured skills are resolved from the same user-scoped catalog as the lead agent, so user-owned custom skills remain available without exposing another user's version. Their internal AI and tool messages stay scoped to the delegated graph instead of entering the parent chat stream. Reloaded thread history enforces the same boundary: callback-captured sub-agent AI responses remain available in run-event diagnostics but are excluded from the parent transcript, while the parent `task` result remains attached to its subtask card. Long-running sub-agents compact older history when summarization is enabled and re-inject the summary as guarded, hidden durable context before continuing, so recent assistant/tool activity remains grounded in the task. Provider/model request failures are reported as failed sub-agent tasks rather than successful results, so the lead agent and Web UI can react to them correctly. Concurrent parent runs also receive independent server-side sub-agent execution IDs, so a provider that reuses a tool-call ID cannot make one run poll, cancel, or clean up another run's background task. Collapsed sub-agent cards show the effective model and, when the provider returns usage metadata, a cumulative token total that updates after each completed sub-agent LLM call and persists after a reload. When token usage tracking is enabled, completed sub-agent usage is attributed back to the dispatching step from that run's terminal tool-message metadata rather than a process-global provider-ID cache.

Ordinary `task` delegation and explicit durable `batch_task` execution share the startup-scoped `subagent_runtime` process capacity. Batch mode keeps large independent item sets in SQL with separate total, live, and running limits, restart recovery, bounded results, and a thread-scoped Web UI panel. The panel pages through bounded previews on demand; full stored result text is available only through the owner-scoped JSONL export, while internal execution and authorization context never enters owner-facing responses. If the batch worker is later stopped or disabled, threads with persisted batches retain read-only item inspection and JSONL export; execution controls remain disabled until the worker is running again. See `config.example.yaml` and [the implementation contract](docs/plans/2026-08-24-subagent-batch-capacity-implementation.md) for limits and recovery semantics.

Direct `create_deerflow_agent(...)` integrations can own the same boundary explicitly instead of relying on Gateway startup. Construct one `SubagentRuntime` and share it across every graph in that application; its `max_running`, ordinary per-run total, bound `task` tool, and optional durable-batch tools then use the same caller-owned snapshot and execution controller. A runtime with a batch repository owns a worker and must be started before graph construction and stopped during application shutdown:

```python
from deerflow.agents import RuntimeFeatures, create_deerflow_agent
from deerflow.subagents import SubagentRuntime

runtime = SubagentRuntime.from_app_config(app_config, batch_repository=batch_repository)
async with runtime:
    graph = create_deerflow_agent(
        model,
        features=RuntimeFeatures(subagent=True),
        subagent_runtime=runtime,
    )
    # Serve or invoke graph while the durable worker is running.
```

The factory still does not load YAML or create SQL infrastructure: the caller supplies the config snapshot, repository, and lifecycle. Because it accepts a caller-owned `system_prompt`, direct integrations also own any model-visible wording about those limits; the default middleware enforces the runtime limits regardless. The factory does not mount the Gateway owner-scoped HTTP routes or Web UI, so direct applications must expose their own result API/UI if they need those surfaces. For ordinary delegation only, `SubagentRuntime(...)` needs no asynchronous startup.

Administrators can add, edit, disable, and delete reusable worker definitions from **Settings → Subagents**. Built-in and `config.yaml` definitions remain visible there as read-only entries. The default Lead Agent can use every enabled runtime sub-agent; each page-created Custom Agent can instead allow all, none, or a selected set. That selection is enforced both in the model-visible directory and by the server-side `task` tool. Managed definitions are deployment-wide in this version and follow `agent_storage.backend`: atomic files for a local deployment or the shared application database for multiple instances.

For example, independent read-only research can run concurrently when the wall-clock savings outweigh duplicated discovery and synthesis cost, while a repository refactor with shared files and sequential test feedback remains with the lead agent. When `max_concurrent_subagents` is `1`, parallel and multi-batch routing guidance is disabled; delegation remains available only for material specialist or context-isolation benefit.

### Sandbox & File System

`E2BSandboxProvider` uses `wait` as its default overflow policy. It waits for
`acquire_timeout`, then fails the agent turn. DeerFlow does not retry the turn
automatically. Clients can use the structured error to schedule a retry.

Use `burst` with `burst_limit` to permit bounded extra VMs. The `wait` and
`reject` policies use only `replicas`. The `reject` policy can remove one warm
VM before it returns an error.

With in-memory ownership, `replicas` limits one Gateway process. With Redis
ownership, E2B shares one capacity Hash between workers using the same
`sandbox.ownership.key_prefix`; `replicas` (plus a configured burst) is then a
deployment-wide hard limit. Use one unique prefix and the same effective limit
per deployment. To change the limit, stop its Gateways, delete the capacity
Hash, and restart; mismatched workers fail closed.

The Hash counts remote VMs and in-flight creates, repairs interrupted creates
from E2B metadata, grace-protects stale inventory omissions, and blocks new
creates while Redis or initial inventory is unavailable. Run Redis with persistence, non-evicting memory, and HA.

E2B acquisition uses a bounded executor. Waiting acquisitions do not use the
default asyncio executor.

Each E2B mount upload pass accepts at most 512 MiB and 2,000 files. The pass
also has a cooperative 120-second deadline. Skill projections and configured
mounts share these limits. The provider checks the deadline before each mount
and during directory preflight. The deadline stops new file uploads after it
expires. It does not interrupt active filesystem or E2B SDK calls.

An E2B VM keeps its slot until E2B confirms destruction. This rule covers
create and reclaim operations. Discovery can find a VM from another Gateway.
Shutdown closes an unowned discovery client without destroying its VM.
Release stops counting a transition when the VM enters the warm pool.
Shutdown races retry remote cleanup after a transient kill failure.
Reset destroys tracked active and warm E2B VMs. The old provider instance
cannot accept new acquisitions.

DeerFlow doesn't just *talk* about doing things. It has its own computer.

Each task gets its own execution environment with a full filesystem view — skills, workspace, uploads, outputs. The agent reads, writes, and edits files. It can view images and, when configured safely, execute shell commands.

The built-in `grep` tool searches either one text file or all matching text files below a directory, so an agent can search an uploaded document directly without first broadening the request to the entire uploads directory.

Image bytes loaded for a vision-model call are transient: DeerFlow removes the hidden base64 message after the model consumes it so later checkpoints do not keep duplicating that payload.

After each run, DeerFlow records a workspace change summary for the run-owned `workspace` and `outputs` directories. The Web UI shows a compact "files changed" badge on the assistant turn; opening it reveals created, modified, and deleted files with text diffs when safe to display. Uploads are excluded because they are user inputs, not agent-generated changes, and stdio MCP temporary/debug files under the DeerFlow-owned `.mcp/` namespace are excluded because they are process-internal state (like `.git/` and `node_modules/`, any directory named `.mcp` is excluded at any depth). Large, binary, or sensitive-looking files are shown as metadata only.

Files presented through `present_files` remain part of the thread's artifact state, and the Web UI restores the artifact panel and selected document after a page refresh. The currently selected formal artifact is refreshed once when the run finishes so edits become visible without a manual reload. Existing UTF-8 text artifacts under `/mnt/user-data/outputs` can also be edited and explicitly saved from the panel on Unix and Windows while the thread is idle; saves use content revisions to prevent overwriting agent changes.

Text artifacts are streamed with HTTP byte-range support. The Web UI initially
loads at most 1 MiB, shows the preview size when a file is larger, and waits for
an explicit **Load full file** action before fetching the remainder or mounting
the full code editor. Active HTML, XHTML, and SVG artifacts remain forced
downloads at the Gateway boundary.

With `AioSandboxProvider`, shell execution runs inside isolated containers. With `LocalSandboxProvider`, file tools still map to per-thread directories on the host, but host `bash` is disabled by default because it is not a secure isolation boundary. Re-enable host bash only for fully trusted local workflows. Host bash commands have a wall-clock timeout, and long-lived processes should be started in the background with output redirected to a workspace log. On Windows, Git Bash/MSYS argument-conversion exclusions are limited to safe non-root virtual path prefixes, so host-native CLI launchers retain their normal MSYS compatibility.

`AioSandboxProvider` normally detects thread-data mounts from its backend: local
containers use the mounted gateway directories, while remote/provisioner
sandboxes receive uploaded files through explicit synchronization. Deployments
where both sides are guaranteed to share the same thread user-data directories
can set `sandbox.thread_data_mounts: true` to skip that per-upload sandbox
acquire and sync. Leave the field unset for automatic detection; setting it
incorrectly can make uploaded files unavailable inside the sandbox.

This is the difference between a chatbot with tool access and an agent with an actual execution environment.

### Agentic Browser Control

Reading a page is not the same as *using* one. Alongside the read-only `web_fetch` and `web_capture` tools, DeerFlow ships an optional agentic browser tool group that keeps a live, per-conversation browser session so the agent can actually operate a page — navigate, read the interactive elements, click, type, submit forms, and follow multi-step flows on JavaScript-heavy sites.

Each action returns a fresh snapshot of the page's interactive elements, each addressed by a stable `[ref]` number, so the agent acts on what it just observed instead of guessing selectors. Outbound URLs are SSRF-screened by default. It is powered by Playwright and shipped as an optional extra so the core install stays lean:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync --extra browser
uv run playwright install chromium
```

Then uncomment the `group: browser` tool entries in `config.yaml` (`browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_get_text`, `browser_back`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_close`). `make dev` / Docker startup detects an enabled `browser_navigate` tool and preserves the `browser` extra on dependency syncs. The Gateway fails startup if browser control is configured but Playwright is missing, and `/api/features` hides the Browser UI unless the backend can actually serve it. Keep `headless: true` and `allow_private_addresses: false` for anything but local, trusted debugging. Attaching to an existing Chrome with `cdp_url` cannot enforce DeerFlow's subresource/redirect SSRF guard and therefore fails closed unless `allow_unguarded_cdp: true` explicitly acknowledges that risk; use it only with a trusted local browser. Browser sessions are process-local; keep `GATEWAY_WORKERS=1` while this tool group is enabled because ordinary uvicorn worker dispatch does not provide thread affinity.

Existing, non-mock Custom Agent chats expose the same Browser Live controls when browser control is available and the agent either leaves `tool_groups` unrestricted or includes the `browser` group. An explicit tool-group allowlist without `browser` keeps those controls hidden.

The workspace Browser Live client negotiates binary JPEG WebSocket frames,
keeps only the newest pending frame per display refresh, and revokes replaced
object URLs. Gateway control messages remain JSON, and clients that do not
request the binary capability retain the legacy JSON/base64 frame protocol.

### Context Engineering

**Isolated Sub-Agent Context**: Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context. This means that the sub-agent will not be able to see the context of the main agent or other sub-agents. This is important to ensure that the sub-agent is able to focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by the context of the main agent or other sub-agents.

**Summarization**: Within a session, DeerFlow manages context aggressively — summarizing completed sub-tasks, offloading intermediate results to the filesystem, compressing what's no longer immediately relevant. This lets it stay sharp across long, multi-step tasks without blowing the context window.

**Strict Tool-Call Recovery**: When a provider or middleware interrupts a tool-call loop, DeerFlow now strips provider-level raw tool-call metadata on forced-stop assistant messages and injects placeholder tool results for dangling calls before the next model invocation. This keeps OpenAI-compatible reasoning models that strictly validate `tool_call_id` sequences from failing with malformed history errors.

**Visible Tool-Run Completion**: For interactive turns, DeerFlow retries an empty post-tool final response once, then surfaces a visible error instead of reporting a silent successful run.

### Long-Term Memory

Most agents forget everything the moment a conversation ends. DeerFlow remembers.

DeerFlow also includes an optional `openviking` memory backend. It uses the
official `langchain-openviking` package to capture completed turns into stable
OpenViking Sessions and recall memory for prompt injection while leaving
DeerMem as the default. The initial integration supports one DeerFlow user with
one credential-bound OpenViking USER API key in `memory.mode: middleware` and
does not inherit arbitrary HTTP headers from `ovcli.conf`.
See [OpenViking memory backend](docs/OPENVIKING.md) for its configuration,
behavior, and current boundaries.

Across sessions, DeerFlow builds a persistent memory of your profile, preferences, and accumulated knowledge. The more you use it, the better it knows you — your writing style, your technical stack, your recurring workflows. Memory is stored locally and stays under your control.

DeerMem remains the default local backend. An opt-in `mem0` backend is also
available for the hosted mem0 Platform API or API-compatible self-hosted
servers. Its token-bearing `base_url` must use HTTPS by default; plaintext HTTP
requires an explicit local-development opt-in. See the
[mem0 backend guide](backend/packages/harness/deerflow/agents/memory/backends/mem0/README.md).

An opt-in `honcho` backend is available for self-hosted or hosted Honcho (v3
API). It builds user-model memory — long-term preferences and a cross-session
working representation — on Honcho's server side, so the backend makes no LLM
calls locally. Each user gets an isolated workspace derived from `user_id`; a
missing user id fails closed instead of falling back to a shared workspace.
Fact CRUD and Settings-page fact editing are not available for this backend. See
the [Honcho backend guide](backend/packages/harness/deerflow/agents/memory/backends/honcho/README.md).

Memory updates now skip duplicate fact entries at apply time, so repeated preferences and context do not accumulate endlessly across sessions.

In the default DeerMem `middleware` mode, automatic extraction now classifies every proposed fact by scope, durability, and authority before a deterministic write gate accepts it. Only durable, descriptive user-level facts are stored; current-thread or project constraints and one-time action permissions stay in conversation state. User-global summaries require both user scope and descriptive authority, contradiction removals are scope-gated, and a replacement-dependent removal is applied only when its replacement actually survives validation and storage. These classification labels are extraction-only metadata, add no extra LLM call, and are not written into the fact files. The explicit CRUD tools in `memory.mode: tool` remain a separate, model-directed path. Deployments that override the bundled DeerMem prompts via `memory.backend_config.prompts_dir` must add the new classification fields to their custom templates (the `memory_update` fact/summary/removal formats and the `consolidation` consolidated-fact schema): the write gate fails closed, so an un-migrated template stops every extraction-driven fact, summary, and removal write, surfacing only through the `rejected_by_scope_gate` metrics and the high-rejection-rate warning.

When a fact scope reaches `max_facts`, DeerMem still uses the historical confidence-only eviction order by default. Operators can opt in to `memory.backend_config.fact_eviction_policy: hybrid-v1`, which combines bounded confidence (65%), explicit-confirmation freshness (25%), and query-driven access heat (10%). Hybrid signal metadata is collected only while hybrid-v1 or shadow mode is enabled. Explicit confirmation is returned as `factsToReinforce` by the existing memory-update LLM call and is accepted only when deterministic message processing also detects a user reinforcement signal; it also resets the fact's staleness-review clock. This deterministic gate is batch-level: it establishes only that a human message among the last six filtered messages in the current extraction batch matched a reinforcement pattern. The LLM-selected `factsToReinforce` ID supplies the fact binding; DeerMem does not independently verify a signal-to-fact correspondence. Repeated extraction or automatic injection never confirms a fact. Custom `memory_update` prompts should add the optional `factsToReinforce` array to participate in confirmation freshness. Access heat is stored in a separate decaying sidecar and increases only when `memory_search` actually returns the fact, so reads do not rewrite canonical Markdown or its `updatedAt`. Hybrid mode also reserves a bounded minimum of correction slots (10% of the cap, at most 10; unused slots return to normal competition). Capacity deletion remains physical, but a bounded metadata-only audit records fact IDs, categories, policy scores, and reasons without copying fact content. `fact_eviction_shadow_enabled: true` evaluates hybrid-v1 alongside the default policy without changing actual retention. This feature adds no LLM invocation and can be rolled back by selecting `confidence`.

File-backed memory now separates global user context from agent facts. Each user has one `memory.json` containing only the project-independent `user` and `history` summaries; every fact is a canonical Markdown file below `agents/{agent_name}/facts/`. Existing lead-agent middleware, API, Settings, import/export, and embedded-client calls that omit `agent_name` resolve inside DeerMem to the reserved `__default__` bucket. That bucket is outside the valid custom-agent name grammar, so a real custom agent named `lead-agent` has a separate fact repository and deleting a custom agent cannot delete a memory-only directory without `config.yaml`. Public agent identifiers are case-insensitive and canonicalized to lowercase. Runtime/API readers still receive a compatibility `facts` array for the selected/default agent, so the frontend does not read agent facts from `memory.json`; structured Markdown `source` metadata is projected to the historical string field at the MemoryManager boundary. An unscoped Clear All first migrates facts from unread legacy per-agent JSON without adopting its soon-to-be-cleared summaries, then removes shared summaries and facts from every agent bucket while preserving agent configuration files, so a later read cannot resurrect skipped legacy facts; an explicitly agent-scoped clear removes only that agent's facts. On first normal read, old facts embedded in the user JSON are migrated automatically to `__default__`; facts written to the earlier implicit `lead-agent` bucket are also moved when that directory is not a real custom agent. Migration and normal writes notify the configured retrieval adapter only after durable storage locks are released. DeerMem uses a scope-aware SQLite FTS5/BM25 adapter by default, stores only rebuildable derived index data under `.retrieval/`, and rebuilds it in the background during Gateway startup or lazily on the first scoped search. A corrupt derived index is recreated automatically. Set `memory.backend_config.retrieval_adapter` to an empty string to disable it and use the local substring fallback. Chinese tokenization is optional; install the backend `memory-zh` extra (`uv sync --extra memory-zh`) for jieba-assisted sub-phrase search. Journaled writes, a shared user lock, and optimistic user-memory revisions prevent silent lost updates.

Memory injection follows the configured operation mode. In `middleware` mode, DeerMem injects the user-global summaries and the selected agent's facts. Custom-agent bootstrap conversations use that agent's fact bucket as well, so setup details do not leak into the default agent's memory. In `tool` mode, the automatic `<memory>` block contains only the global `user` and `history` summaries; agent facts are retrieved explicitly through `memory_search`, avoiding duplicate automatic and tool-returned fact context. Setting `memory.injection_enabled: false` still disables the entire block in either mode.

Single-fact repository operations are genuinely incremental: an upsert/delete reads, journals, writes, and re-indexes only the addressed fact files, and returns an explicit incomplete delta rather than a cache-dependent fake full document. Summary change sets merge the supplied `user`/`history` child keys over the persisted sections so a partial update cannot erase omitted siblings; full imports normalize both sections to the complete compatibility schema before applying replacement values. Manager/API compatibility methods materialize a fresh full document only when their public response contract requires one. Fact-level point operations use separate expected user-memory and fact revisions and may explicitly rebase when every addressed fact precondition still holds. Snapshot-derived operations such as scoped clear, capped create, consolidation, and trimming never replay stale delete/trim sets: a manifest conflict reloads the complete document and recomputes the operation, with a bounded retry. Fact paths use the first two hexadecimal characters of `SHA-256(fact_id)` so generated `fact_*` IDs distribute across shards. The cache token combines the shared JSON's nanosecond mtime, size, and persisted revision; this prevents coarse-mtime same-size writes from returning stale data without scanning fact files. Direct out-of-band Markdown edits require an explicit reload. Storage-specific conflicts and corruption are translated at the MemoryManager boundary; the Gateway returns conflict as HTTP 409 and a stable, non-sensitive corruption error as HTTP 500. Full-document `save()` remains a compatibility API and computes a diff before writing; malformed or missing `facts` can no longer silently erase an agent's Markdown files. Legacy migration preserves non-empty `user`/`history` before deleting an agent `memory.json`; conflicting summaries keep the legacy file and fail loudly instead of choosing a winner.

Legacy facts in `memory.json` migrate automatically into the reserved `__default__` Markdown bucket on the user's first normal memory read. Operators who prefer to audit or complete the migration before serving traffic can run the optional idempotent CLI from `backend/`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/migrate_memory_markdown.py --all-users --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/migrate_memory_markdown.py --all-users
# A custom DeerMem root or original non-directory-safe identity can be explicit:
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/migrate_memory_markdown.py --storage-path /path/to/deerflow-home --user-id 'test@example.com'
```

The v1-to-v2 storage migration is one-way for a running application: pre-PR code does not read Markdown facts. Before upgrading a persistent deployment, stop DeerFlow and take a filesystem snapshot or full backup of the configured memory storage root. The migration also durably retains each destructive JSON source beside the original path as `{manifest_filename}.v1.bak` before writing v2 data; an existing mismatched backup or a backup-write failure stops migration without modifying the v1 source. This local backup preserves pre-migration data but is not a substitute for a full snapshot and does not contain facts created after the upgrade.

`--user-id` may be repeated. `--all-users` discovers the existing directory-safe buckets below the selected storage root; standalone integrations that passed raw IDs containing characters such as `@` should use the original value with `--user-id`. A failed user's migration is reported without hiding the rest of the audit, and the command exits non-zero when any user fails. The automatic first-read path remains enabled, so running this CLI is not required for startup.

## Recommended Models

DeerFlow is model-agnostic — it works with any LLM that implements the OpenAI-compatible API. That said, it performs best with models that support:

- **Long context windows** (100k+ tokens) for deep research and multi-step tasks
- **Reasoning capabilities** for adaptive planning and complex decomposition
- **Multimodal inputs** for image understanding and video comprehension
- **Strong tool-use** for reliable function calling and structured outputs

## Embedded Python Client

DeerFlow can be used as an embedded Python library without running the full HTTP services. The `DeerFlowClient` provides direct in-process access to all agent and Gateway capabilities, returning the same response schemas as the HTTP Gateway API. The HTTP Gateway also exposes `DELETE /api/threads/{thread_id}` to remove DeerFlow-managed local thread data after the LangGraph thread itself has been deleted:

Thread IDs may be supplied by callers and do not have to be UUIDs. Explicit
IDs must contain 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores
(`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`). DeerFlow generates a UUID only when `thread_id` is
omitted or `None`; an explicitly supplied empty string is invalid.
Existing route-addressable threads created under older, looser rules remain
readable and deletable, but cannot start new runs or create new filesystem or
sandbox state. Legacy deletion skips local path cleanup when the ID is not
safe under the canonical contract. For canonical legacy threads whose
conversation exists only in LangGraph checkpoints, DeerFlow seeds an empty
run-event feed from the checkpoint before the first new run so
`/messages/page` keeps both the old and new turns.

```python
from deerflow.client import DeerFlowClient

client = DeerFlowClient()

# Chat
response = client.chat("Analyze this paper for me", thread_id="my-thread")

# Streaming (LangGraph SSE protocol: values, messages-tuple, end)
for event in client.stream("hello"):
    if event.type == "messages-tuple" and event.data.get("type") == "ai":
        print(event.data["content"])
    elif event.type == "messages-tuple" and event.data.get("type") == "tool" and "artifact" in event.data:
        # Structured tool artifacts (for example, ask_clarification cards)
        # are preserved when the ToolMessage provides one.
        print(event.data["artifact"])

# Configuration & management — returns Gateway-aligned dicts
models = client.list_models()        # {"models": [...]}
skills = client.list_skills()        # {"skills": [...]}
client.update_skill("web-search", enabled=True)
client.upload_files("thread-1", ["./report.pdf"])  # {"success": True, "files": [...]}
client.set_goal("thread-1", "finish the implementation and make all tests pass")
client.get_goal("thread-1")       # {"goal": {...}} or {"goal": None}
client.clear_goal("thread-1")
```

The HTTP Gateway accepts `values`, `messages-tuple`, `updates`, `debug`, `tasks`, `checkpoints`, and `custom` stream modes. Unsupported modes such as `messages` and `events`, unsupported non-default run options such as webhooks, delayed execution, or `multitask_strategy="enqueue"`, and undeclared SDK options such as checkpoint durability overrides return `422` before execution instead of being silently ignored or downgraded.

All dict-returning methods are validated against Gateway Pydantic response models in CI (`TestGatewayConformance`), ensuring the embedded client stays in sync with the HTTP API schemas. See `backend/packages/harness/deerflow/client.py` for full API documentation.

## Scheduled Tasks

DeerFlow now includes a first-class scheduled-task MVP in the workspace.

Current MVP capabilities:

- Manage tasks at `/workspace/scheduled-tasks`
- Choose whether each scheduled task reuses a thread and its conversation history or creates a fresh thread per run
- Support `once` and `cron` schedules
- Run background scheduled executions as non-interactive DeerFlow runs (`ask_clarification` is not exposed there)
- Persist a due execution as `queued` when its reused thread or the global execution budget is busy, then launch it when capacity is available; queued occurrences survive Gateway restarts and fail after `scheduler.queue_timeout_seconds`
- Freeze a task's definition while an occurrence is `queued`, `launching`, or `running`, so a durable occurrence cannot silently pick up a different prompt, thread, or schedule; transitioning a task to paused or deleting it cancels an existing waiting occurrence, while `launching`/`running` work must finish before those mutations are retried and an explicit manual trigger may still wait and run without resuming a paused schedule
- Pause, resume, trigger, inspect history, and delete tasks
- Execute scheduled work through the normal DeerFlow run lifecycle

Current MVP limits:

- No conversation-created `schedule_task` tool yet
- No text-only notification jobs
- No channel or GitHub dispatch targets
- No `interval` schedule type in this first cut

Enable background polling with `config.yaml -> scheduler.enabled`. Manual trigger uses the same scheduled-task resource and execution path.

Scheduled runs use `scheduler.recursion_limit` in `config.yaml` (default `1000`, matching the web UI's interactive budget). Values above `max_recursion_limit` are clamped. This field is read at dispatch, so the next scheduled run picks it up without a Gateway restart.

The background scheduler is single-instance by default. For a multi-pod deployment, set `scheduler.multi_instance: true` and use shared Postgres, `run_ownership.heartbeat_enabled: true`, and `run_events.backend: db`; startup and periodic recovery then preserve live peer runs, atomically return expired launch claims to the queue, take over only expired run leases, and fence stale launch writes. `max_concurrent_runs` is a shared global cap across Pods for `launching`/`running` occurrences; waiting `queued` rows do not consume it. Without those settings, enable the scheduler on exactly one Gateway pod. These scheduler fields are startup-only; restart all Gateway Pods together when changing them.

### Upgrade Notes

- Before upgrading a deployment with `GATEWAY_WORKERS > 1` and `scheduler.enabled: true`, either keep the scheduler on exactly one Gateway worker or configure `scheduler.multi_instance: true` with shared Postgres, `run_ownership.heartbeat_enabled: true`, and `run_events.backend: db`. The upgraded Gateway rejects the unsafe combination at startup instead of starting silently.
- In multi-instance mode, `scheduler.max_concurrent_runs` is a cluster-wide execution cap, not a per-Pod cap. It includes `launching` and `running` scheduled occurrences, so capacity does not multiply with the number of replicas; durable waiting rows remain outside the cap.
- `scheduler.multi_instance` and the related scheduler, ownership, and run-event settings are startup-only. Apply changes with a coordinated restart of all Gateway Pods; changing the ConfigMap alone does not activate multi-instance recovery.

## Terminal Workbench (TUI)

`deerflow` is a terminal-native workbench for people who live in the shell. It runs **embedded** over `DeerFlowClient` — no Gateway, frontend, nginx, or Docker required — while honoring the same `config.yaml`, checkpointer, skills, memory, MCP, and sandbox settings as the rest of DeerFlow.

![DeerFlow TUI](docs/tui/tui-preview.svg)

```bash
uv pip install 'deerflow-harness[tui]'        # optional 'textual' dependency

deerflow                                      # launch the terminal UI (TTY required)
deerflow --tui-transparent                    # use the terminal's default background
deerflow --continue                           # resume the most recent thread
deerflow --resume THREAD                      # resume a thread by id
deerflow --print "summarize this repo"        # headless one-shot answer to stdout
deerflow --json  "hello"                       # headless newline-delimited StreamEvents
deerflow --recursion-limit 250 --print "task" # override the headless agent-loop limit
```

A keyboard-driven chat surface with a streaming transcript (Markdown-rendered answers), compact tool-activity cards, a `/` slash-command palette, display-only `/clear`, `/goal` goal management, `/model` and `/threads` pickers, input history, PageUp/PageDown transcript navigation, and `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` interrupt. Transcript refreshes preserve your reading position after you scroll upward and resume following new output when you return to the bottom. `/clear` removes rows from the current terminal display without deleting the thread or its persisted conversation; `/new` and `/clear` ask you to wait during an active run instead of resetting in-flight display state. Sessions opened in the TUI also appear in the Web UI sidebar — it writes the shared thread store under the local default user, so terminal and web stay in sync **without running the Gateway**.

See [backend/docs/TUI.md](backend/docs/TUI.md) for the full guide.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

### Improper Deployment May Introduce Security Risks

DeerFlow has key high-privilege capabilities including **system command execution, resource operations, and business logic invocation**, and is designed by default to be **deployed in a local trusted environment (accessible only via the 127.0.0.1 loopback interface)**. If you deploy the agent in untrusted environments — such as LAN networks, public cloud servers, or other multi-endpoint accessible environments — without strict security measures, it may introduce security risks, including:

- **Unauthorized illegal invocation**: Agent functionality could be discovered by unauthorized third parties or malicious internet scanners, triggering bulk unauthorized requests that execute high-risk operations such as system commands and file read/write, potentially causing serious security consequences.
- **Compliance and legal risks**: If the agent is illegally invoked to conduct cyberattacks, data theft, or other illegal activities, it may result in legal liability and compliance risks.

### Gateway Admin Is Equivalent to Code Execution

An admin can register stdio MCP servers, which run commands inside the Gateway
container. The API restricts them to an allowlist (`npx`, `uvx` by default,
extended via `DEER_FLOW_MCP_STDIO_COMMAND_ALLOWLIST`) and rejects arguments and
environment variables that would evaluate arbitrary code. That is defense in
depth, not a boundary: these launchers exist to fetch and run remote packages,
so **treat Gateway admin as equivalent to code execution on the host** and grant
it accordingly.

### Deployment Defaults

The Docker stack publishes its entry port on `127.0.0.1` only, matching the
local-trusted-environment model described above. To reach it from another
machine, set `BIND_HOST` in `.env` (e.g. `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`) — and only after
putting the security measures below in place.

**Complete first-run setup before the host becomes reachable.** A fresh
instance has no accounts yet, so create the admin account through `/setup`
immediately after starting any deployment that is not loopback-only.

### Security Recommendations

**Note: We strongly recommend deploying DeerFlow in a local trusted network environment.** If you need cross-device or cross-network deployment, you must implement strict security measures, such as:

- **IP allowlist**: Use `iptables`, or deploy hardware firewalls / switches with Access Control Lists (ACL), to **configure IP allowlist rules** and deny access from all other IP addresses.
- **Authentication gateway**: Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) and **enable strong pre-authentication**, blocking any unauthenticated access.
- **Network isolation**: Where possible, place the agent and trusted devices in the **same dedicated VLAN**, isolated from other network devices.
- **Stay updated**: Continue to follow DeerFlow's security feature updates.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, workflow, and guidelines.

Backend `make test` is offline by default and excludes live external-API
coverage. Maintainers can explicitly run the real `DeerFlowClient` integration
suite with `cd backend && make test-live` after providing a valid root
`config.yaml` and API credentials; this may incur API costs and create local
sandboxes, artifacts, or files. Direct pytest runs additionally require
`DEER_FLOW_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`.

Regression coverage includes Docker sandbox mode detection and provisioner kubeconfig-path handling tests in `backend/tests/`.
Backend blocking-IO diagnostics are available from the repository root with
`make detect-blocking-io`: it statically scans backend business code for
blocking IO that may run on the backend event loop, prints a concise summary,
and writes complete JSON findings to `.deer-flow/blocking-io-findings.json`.
The JSON includes compact review records with `priority`, `location`,
`blocking_call`, `event_loop_exposure`, `reason`, and `code`.
Gateway artifact serving now forces active web content types (`text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) to download as attachments instead of inline rendering, reducing XSS risk for generated artifacts.

Frontend route asset budgets can be checked with `cd frontend && pnpm
perf:check`. The command measures `/login` from a normal production build, then
performs a production static-demo build for the fixture-backed workspace routes.
It measures the unique JavaScript and CSS referenced by representative routes
and writes the detailed result to `.next/performance-results.json`.
