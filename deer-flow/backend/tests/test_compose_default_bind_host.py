"""Regression test for the Docker Compose default published bind address.

``README.md`` documents DeerFlow as being deployed by default "in a local
trusted environment (accessible only via the 127.0.0.1 loopback interface)",
but the shipped compose files published the nginx entry as
``"${PORT:-2026}:2026"``, which Docker binds to ``0.0.0.0`` (and ``[::]``). The
shipped artifact therefore did not match its own documented default, and an
operator running it on a LAN or cloud host got a wider surface than the docs
implied without changing anything.

The Gateway itself binds ``0.0.0.0`` inside the container on purpose (nginx has
to reach it over the compose network) and its port is deliberately not
published, so the published nginx port is the whole external surface. This test
pins the loopback default there while keeping it overridable for operators who
intentionally expose the stack behind their own TLS/auth front door.
