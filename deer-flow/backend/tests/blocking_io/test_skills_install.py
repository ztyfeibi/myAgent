"""Regression anchor: skill archive installation must not block the event loop.

``LocalSkillStorage.ainstall_skill_from_archive`` is the async entry point the
gateway ``POST /skills/install`` route awaits. It extracts the archive,
validates frontmatter, security-scans every installable file, and stages the
skill into the custom directory — all filesystem work that previously ran
inline on the event loop (zip extract, ``rglob`` enumeration, ``read_text``,
``shutil.copytree``). The fix offloads those phases via ``asyncio.to_thread``
while keeping the per-file LLM security scan as the only awaited work; if any
phase regresses back onto the loop, the strict Blockbuster gate raises
``BlockingError`` and this test fails.

Only the external LLM boundary (``scan_skill_content``) is stubbed — the
archive, extraction, validation, and staging all run against the real local
filesystem. Test-side setup IO is itself offloaded with ``asyncio.to_thread``
(matching ``test_agents_router``) so only the production path is exercised on
the loop.
