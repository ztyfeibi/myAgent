"""Pin fail-loud repo-root resolution and the shared CLI shim for the detector tooling.

The failure mode being guarded: depth-indexed `parents[N]` resolution from a
relocated detector file silently resolves a wrong root, scans nothing, and
reports zero findings. Resolution must instead raise when no repository
marker is found.
