"""Regression test for migration ``0007_scheduled_run_active_index`` dedupe pass.

End-to-end shape (mirrors ``test_migration_0004_run_ownership_dedupe``):

1. Hand-build a SQLite DB that mirrors a real pre-0007 deployment that ran the
   racy ``dispatch_task`` check-then-insert and accumulated duplicate active
   rows per ``task_id`` (the exact dirty state the partial unique index
   targets).
2. Stamp it at ``0006_agents`` so ``bootstrap_schema`` takes the
   versioned branch and runs ``alembic upgrade head``.
3. Insert two+ queued/running rows for the same ``task_id`` (only possible
   because the partial unique index does not exist yet).
4. Run ``init_engine`` (the FastAPI lifespan entry point), which routes through
   ``bootstrap_schema`` -> ``upgrade head`` -> ``0007.upgrade()``.
5. Verify the migration superseded the older duplicates (set them to
   ``interrupted`` with an explanatory message + ``finished_at``), successfully
   built the ``uq_scheduled_task_run_active`` partial unique index, and let the
   later scheduler-enqueue migration normalize the surviving legacy ``queued``
   row before durable queue semantics become active.

Pre-fix codepath would have raised ``UNIQUE constraint failed`` (SQLite) /
``could not create unique index`` (Postgres) on step 5, aborting the alembic
upgrade and blocking gateway startup.
