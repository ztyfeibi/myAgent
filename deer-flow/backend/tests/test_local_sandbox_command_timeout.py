"""Regression tests for blocking-command timeout handling in LocalSandbox.

These pin the fix for the "starting a server hangs the whole turn" bug:
a backgrounded long-lived process must not keep the bash tool blocked until
the timeout, and a genuinely blocking foreground command must be terminated
(process group and all) once it exceeds the timeout.

The POSIX cases exercise real subprocess/process-group semantics, so they are
skipped on Windows. Windows keeps the ``subprocess.run`` path, but timeout
errors still use the same user-facing notice.
