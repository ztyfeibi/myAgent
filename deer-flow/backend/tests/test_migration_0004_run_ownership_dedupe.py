"""Regression test for migration ``0004_run_ownership`` dedupe pass.

End-to-end shape:

1. Hand-build a SQLite DB that mirrors a real pre-0004 deployment that ran
   ``GATEWAY_WORKERS>1`` before this PR and accumulated duplicate active rows
   per thread (the exact dirty state the multi-worker ownership fix targets).
2. Stamp it at ``0003_scheduled_tasks`` so ``bootstrap_schema`` takes the
   versioned branch and runs ``alembic upgrade head``.
3. Insert two+ pending/running rows for the same ``thread_id`` (only possible
   because the partial unique index does not exist yet).
4. Run ``init_engine`` (the FastAPI lifespan entry point), which routes
   through ``bootstrap_schema`` → ``upgrade head`` → ``0004.upgrade()``.
5. Verify the migration cancelled the superseded duplicates (set them to
   ``error`` with an explanatory message), kept the newest active row, and
   successfully built the ``uq_runs_thread_active`` partial unique index.

Pre-fix codepath would have raised ``UNIQUE constraint failed`` (SQLite) /
``could not create unique index`` (Postgres) on step 5, aborting the alembic
upgrade and blocking gateway startup.
