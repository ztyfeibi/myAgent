"""Tests for the SKILL.md parser regression introduced in issue #1803.

The previous hand-rolled YAML parser stored quoted string values with their
surrounding quotes intact (e.g. ``name: "my-skill"`` → ``'"my-skill"'``).
This caused a mismatch with ``_validate_skill_frontmatter`` (which uses
``yaml.safe_load``) and broke skill lookup after installation.

The parser now uses ``yaml.safe_load`` consistently with ``validation.py``.
