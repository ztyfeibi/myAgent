"""Memory manager contract + pluggable backend factory.

This module is the shared, backend-agnostic core of the memory package. It
defines the :class:`MemoryManager` interface (9 methods) that every backend
implements, plus a singleton :func:`get_memory_manager` factory that resolves
the active backend from ``MemoryConfig.manager_class``.

Swap backend = drop a ``backends/<name>/`` folder exposing ``MANAGER_CLASS``
and set ``manager_class: <name>``. Nothing else in deer-flow changes.

Scope note: this phase is *pluggable only*, not black-box. Agent-side
conventions (``enabled`` gating at call sites, ``<memory>`` wrapping in
``_get_memory_context``) stay where they are; they are backend-agnostic and
do not impede pluggability.

    A pydantic ``BaseModel`` (not a bare ``ABC``) so the contract gains field
    validation + serialization for free and shares the pydantic v2 type system
    with backend configs (e.g. ``DeerMemConfig``). Subclasses still MUST
    implement the ``@abstractmethod``s -- pydantic's ``ModelMetaclass`` derives
    from ``ABCMeta``, so unimplemented abstractmethods raise ``TypeError`` at
    instantiation (memory is persistent state; a backend missing ``add`` /
    ``get_context`` is a severe bug, caught at construction). Backend-private
    dependencies (storage / llm / queue / ...) are NOT fields -- they are
    ``PrivateAttr`` set in ``model_post_init`` (or ``from_config``), kept out of
    validation / serialization.

    Memories are bucketed per ``(agent_name, user_id)``; ``thread_id`` aligns
    with the deer-flow conversation thread. The contract is deliberately
    neutral so a third-party memory system can be adapted without deer-flow
    code changes:

    - :meth:`get_context` returns plain injection text; the *format* is the
      implementation's own choice and is NOT part of the contract (DeerMem
      does load + ``format_memory_for_injection``; another backend may do
      its own search + formatting).
    - :meth:`add` / :meth:`add_nowait` take raw conversation messages; any
      filtering / correction-/reinforcement-detection is the implementation's
      private concern (not on the contract).
    - No facts-model assumption: a backend need not store "facts" at all.

    Methods are tiered: tier-1 (``add`` / ``get_context``) are ``@abstractmethod``;
    tier-2 management ops and tier-3 optional hooks carry defaults (``raise
    NotImplementedError`` or a no-op) so a backend implements only what it
    supports. ``delete_memory`` / ``export_memory`` are dead contract (zero
    callers; ``/memory/export`` routes via ``get_memory``) kept available via the
    default raise.

# LLM). The portable backend package never names a deer-flow concept; the host
# supplies them HERE (host code outside ``backends/deermem/``). The factory
# passes them to ``cls.from_config(..., **host_hooks)``; each backend's
# ``from_config`` consumes the ones it needs (DeerMem does; noop ignores them).
# An explicit value in ``backend_config`` (set programmatically) takes
# precedence and is left untouched (from_config's merge skips present keys).
#
# Imports are lazy (matching the ``runtime_home`` precedent) so this module
# stays cheap to import and so another agent vendoring the contract only has
# to edit these helpers, not the top-level imports.
