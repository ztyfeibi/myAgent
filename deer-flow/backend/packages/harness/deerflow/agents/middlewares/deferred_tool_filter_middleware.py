"""Middleware to filter deferred tool schemas from model binding.

When tool_search is enabled, MCP tools are still passed to ToolNode for
execution, but their schemas must NOT be sent to the LLM via bind_tools until
the model has discovered them via tool_search. This middleware removes the
still-deferred tools from request.tools before model binding, and blocks tool
calls to tools that have not been promoted yet.

The deferred name set and the catalog hash are injected at construction time
(no ContextVar). Promotion state is read from graph state (``state["promoted"]``),
scoped by catalog hash so a stale persisted promotion cannot expose a renamed
or drifted tool.
