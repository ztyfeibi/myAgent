"""Repair AIMessages the provider safety-terminated so they are neither
executed nor persisted empty.

Background — see issues bytedance/deer-flow#3028 (truncated tool calls) and
#4393 (empty response poisons the thread).

Some providers (OpenAI ``finish_reason='content_filter'``, Anthropic
``stop_reason='refusal'``, Gemini ``finish_reason='SAFETY'`` ...) can stop
generation mid-stream while still returning partially-formed ``tool_calls``.
LangChain's tool router treats any AIMessage with a non-empty ``tool_calls``
field as "go execute these", so half-truncated arguments — e.g. a markdown
``write_file`` that stops in the middle of a sentence — get dispatched as if
they were complete. The agent then sees the truncated file, tries to fix it,
gets filtered again, and loops.

This middleware sits at ``after_model`` and gates that behaviour: when a
configured ``SafetyTerminationDetector`` fires it either

* strips the AIMessage's tool calls (both structured and raw provider
  payloads) when it carries any — the truncated-tool-call case (#3028), or
* backfills a user-facing explanation when the message is otherwise blank
  (no tool calls, no visible content) — the empty-response case (#4393),
  where the empty assistant message would otherwise be persisted and then
  rejected by strict OpenAI-compatible providers on every following request
  ("message ... with role 'assistant' must not be empty"), stranding the
  whole thread until a new chat is started.

A safety-terminated message that carries visible text but no tool calls is
left untouched so its partial answer still reaches the user. Either way we
append the explanation and stash observability fields in
``additional_kwargs.safety_termination`` so logs, traces, and SSE consumers
can see what happened.

Hook choice: ``after_model`` (not ``wrap_model_call``) because the response
is a *normal* return — not an exception — and we want to participate in the
same after-model chain as ``LoopDetectionMiddleware``, with which we share
the same tool-call-suppression mechanic but a different trigger.

Placement: register *after* ``LoopDetectionMiddleware`` in the middleware
list. LangChain factory wires ``after_model`` edges in reverse list order
(``langchain/agents/factory.py:add_edge("model", middleware_w_after_model[-1])``,
then walks ``range(len-1, 0, -1)``), so the *last* registered middleware is
the *first* to observe the model output. Registering Safety after Loop
means Safety sees the raw response first, clears tool calls if it fires,
and Loop then accounts against the cleaned message.
