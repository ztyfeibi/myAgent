"""Neutralize prompt-injection control tokens in untrusted tool results.

DeerFlow already treats the genuine user message as untrusted and neutralizes
framework/injection tags in it (see ``InputSanitizationMiddleware``). Remote
content that the agent *fetches* — web page bodies and search snippets returned
by ``web_fetch`` / ``web_search`` / ``image_search``, plus the target site's
response-status text surfaced by ``web_capture`` — is equally untrusted, yet
it entered the model context verbatim. A page the attacker controls could embed
a forged ``<system-reminder>`` block (or a ``--- END USER INPUT ---`` marker) and
have it reach the model as authoritative framework context.

This middleware narrows that gap by applying the *same* structural
neutralization (``neutralize_untrusted_tags``) to the results of the first-party
network tools, so a fetched ``<system-reminder>`` is escaped to
``&lt;system-reminder&gt;`` exactly like it would be in direct user input. It
deliberately targets only the remote-content tools: local tool output (bash,
file reads) is left untouched so legitimate code/log content is never mangled.

Scope note: matching is a name-based allowlist, so MCP-provided remote-content
tools registered under other names are not yet covered — see
``_REMOTE_CONTENT_TOOL_NAMES``.

# remote-content tool under an arbitrary name (e.g. ``fetch_url`` /
# ``scrape_page``); its results are equally untrusted but are NOT matched here,
# so they reach the model unneutralized. A name heuristic (matching
# fetch/search/crawl substrings) is intentionally avoided because it would also
# mangle legitimate *local* tool output (e.g. a ``file_search`` result). Robust
# MCP coverage should tag remote-content tools via metadata at registration
# rather than by name; tracked as a follow-up.
