"""Middleware to fix dangling tool calls and orphan tool results in message history.

A dangling tool call occurs when an AIMessage contains tool_calls but there are
no corresponding ToolMessages in the history (e.g., due to user interruption or
request cancellation). An orphan ToolMessage occurs when a tool result exists
without a matching AIMessage tool_call (e.g., after summarization/branching
dropped the upstream AIMessage). Both cause strict-provider rejections.

This middleware intercepts the model call to:
- Sanitize malformed tool-call names and arguments before provider serialization
- Insert synthetic ToolMessages with an error indicator for each dangling AIMessage
  tool_call, ensuring correct message ordering
- Drop orphan ToolMessages whose originating tool_call is no longer present in the
  request, preventing strict OpenAI-compatible backends from returning HTTP 400

Note: Uses wrap_model_call instead of before_model to ensure patches are inserted
at the correct positions (immediately after each dangling AIMessage), not appended
to the end of the message list as before_model + add_messages reducer would do.
