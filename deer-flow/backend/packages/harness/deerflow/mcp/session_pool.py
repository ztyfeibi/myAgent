"""Persistent MCP session pool for stateful tool calls.

When MCP tools are loaded via langchain-mcp-adapters with ``session=None``,
each tool call creates a new MCP session. For stateful servers like Playwright,
this means browser state (opened pages, filled forms) is lost between calls.

This module provides a session pool that maintains persistent MCP sessions,
scoped by ``(server_name, scope_key)`` — typically scope_key is the thread_id —
so that consecutive tool calls share the same session and server-side state.
Sessions are evicted in LRU order when the pool reaches capacity.

Lifecycle model (owner task)
----------------------------
An MCP ``ClientSession`` is implemented on top of an ``anyio`` task group, and
anyio enforces that a cancel scope must be exited from the *same task* that
entered it. Calling ``cm.__aexit__`` from any task other than the one that ran
``cm.__aenter__`` raises::

    RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it
    was entered in

The sync-tool path (``make_sync_tool_wrapper``) drives each call through a fresh
``asyncio.run`` event loop, so a session entered while answering one call would
otherwise be exited while answering another — from a different task — and crash
(GitHub issue #3379).

To make this impossible, every pooled session is owned by a dedicated
``_run_session`` task. That task enters the context manager, hands the live
session back to the caller, and then *waits* on a close event. All shutdown
paths only ever **signal** that event; the owner task performs ``__aexit__``
itself, guaranteeing enter and exit always happen in the same task.
