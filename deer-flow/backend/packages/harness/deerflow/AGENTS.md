### Request Trace Context (`packages/harness/deerflow/trace_context.py`)

Request trace correlation is controlled by `logging.enhance.enabled` at **both** entry points, gated through the shared helper `deerflow.config.app_config.is_trace_correlation_enabled` so the Gateway and embedded paths cannot drift:

- **Gateway HTTP**: `app.gateway.trace_middleware.TraceMiddleware` binds one request-level trace id per HTTP request, inheriting inbound `X-Trace-Id` when present or generating a new id otherwise. A **valid** inbound header also marks the request so `runtime/runs/worker.py` prefers that id over `config.metadata.deerflow_trace_id`, keeping logs, response headers, Langfuse, and runtime context aligned when callers send both. The middleware writes the final value to every HTTP response at `http.response.start`, which covers SSE / streaming responses without consuming the body.
- **Embedded / TUI / CLI**: `DeerFlowClient.stream()` mints (or inherits) a request-level trace id per turn only when the flag is on. When it is off, no fresh id is minted — a caller that explicitly wraps `stream()` in `request_trace_context(...)` still opts in, because the downstream `get_current_trace_id()` read propagates that value into Langfuse metadata regardless of the flag. Because `stream()` is a sync generator (which shares the caller's context), the id binding is set/reset around each `next()` step rather than around `yield from`: this keeps LangGraph node execution and its log records inside the binding, while returning control to the caller with the ContextVar restored — avoids cross-request leak between yields and `ValueError: <Token> was created in a different Context` on GC-driven close of an abandoned generator (regression pinned by `tests/test_client_langfuse_metadata.py::test_stream_does_not_leak_trace_id_to_caller_context_between_yields` and `::test_stream_abandoned_generator_close_does_not_raise_cross_context`).

The same ContextVar value is injected into enhanced log records as `trace_id` and into Langfuse metadata as `deerflow_trace_id`.

`logging` is registered as a **restart-required** field
(`STARTUP_ONLY_FIELDS["logging"]`): `configure_logging()` installs the trace-context
filter and enhanced formatter on root handlers only during app.py lifespan startup,
and `TraceMiddleware` captures `logging.enhance.enabled` once when the FastAPI app
is constructed (via `resolve_trace_enabled(get_app_config())` in `create_app()`,
itself a thin alias for `is_trace_correlation_enabled`). This keeps the response
`X-Trace-Id` header, log `trace_id` fields, and Langfuse `deerflow_trace_id`
coherent — a runtime `config.yaml` edit to `logging.enhance.*` needs a Gateway
restart to take effect. The `deerflow_trace_id` chain inherits this guarantee
transitively because every injection point ultimately reads the same
`trace_context` ContextVar that the middleware alone populates. `DeerFlowClient`
reads its own `self._app_config` snapshot (captured at `__init__`) through the
same helper for the embedded gate.

`deerflow_trace_id` is a DeerFlow correlation metadata key, not Langfuse's native
trace id and not a DeerFlow `run_id`. Keep the existing subagent `trace_id` field
separate: that short id is still only for subagent execution logs/status.

### Browser Progress Screenshots (`community/browser_automation/`)

Hidden per-action browser progress frames use JPEG at quality 80 to keep their
storage and transfer cost bounded relative to lossless PNG. The explicit
`browser_screenshot` tool remains PNG because it creates a user-requested
artifact. New automatic capture entry points must reuse the shared progress
encoding definition in `tools.py` so the byte encoding and `.jpg` suffix cannot
drift.

### Embedded Client (`packages/harness/deerflow/client.py`)

`DeerFlowClient` provides direct in-process access to all DeerFlow capabilities without HTTP services. All return types align with the Gateway API response schemas, so consumer code works identically in HTTP and embedded modes.

**Architecture**: Imports the same `deerflow` modules that Gateway API uses. Shares the same config files and data directories. No FastAPI dependency.

**Agent Conversation**:
- `chat(message, thread_id)` — synchronous, accumulates streaming deltas per message-id and returns the final AI text
- `stream(message, thread_id)` — subscribes to LangGraph `stream_mode=["values", "messages", "custom"]` and yields `StreamEvent`:
  - `"values"` — full state snapshot (title, messages, artifacts); AI text already delivered via `messages` mode is **not** re-synthesized here to avoid duplicate deliveries; serialized `ToolMessage` entries preserve a non-`None` native `artifact`
  - `"messages-tuple"` — per-chunk update: for AI text this is a **delta** (concat per `id` to rebuild the full message); tool calls and tool results are emitted once each, and tool results preserve a non-`None` native `artifact`
  - `"custom"` — forwarded from `StreamWriter`; DeerFlow-built-in custom events are dual-emitted through `deerflow.utils.custom_events`, so `astream_events(version="v2")` consumers also receive one `on_custom_event` with `name=payload["type"]` and the unchanged payload as `data`
  - `"end"` — stream finished (carries cumulative `usage` counted once per message id)
- **Custom-event invariant** — production DeerFlow emitters must use `emit_custom_event` / `aemit_custom_event`, not call `StreamWriter` alone. Every built-in payload must carry a non-empty string `type`; typeless payloads remain writer-only and are intentionally absent from `astream_events`. The writer runs first and remains authoritative for Gateway, Web UI, and embedded-client compatibility; callback dispatch is best-effort and must not break that path. Async graph hooks must await the async helper rather than invoking synchronous dispatch on a running event loop.
- Agent created lazily via `create_agent()` + `build_middlewares()`, same as `make_lead_agent`
- Supports `checkpointer` parameter for state persistence across turns
- `reset_agent()` forces agent recreation (e.g. after memory or skill changes)
- See [docs/STREAMING.md](../../../docs/STREAMING.md) for the full design: why Gateway and DeerFlowClient are parallel paths, LangGraph's `stream_mode` semantics, the per-id dedup invariants, and regression testing strategy

**Gateway Equivalent Methods** (replaces Gateway API):

| Category | Methods | Return format |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Models | `list_models()`, `get_model(name)` | `{"models": [...]}`, `{name, display_name, ...}` |
| MCP | `get_mcp_config()`, `update_mcp_config(servers)` | `{"mcp_servers": {...}}` |
| Skills | `list_skills()`, `get_skill(name)`, `update_skill(name, enabled)`, `install_skill(path)` | `{"skills": [...]}` |
| Goals | `get_goal(thread_id)`, `set_goal(thread_id, objective, max_continuations=8)`, `clear_goal(thread_id)` | `{"goal": {...}}` or `{"goal": None}` |
| Memory | `get_memory()`, `reload_memory()`, `get_memory_config()`, `get_memory_status()` | dict |
| Uploads | `upload_files(thread_id, files)`, `list_uploads(thread_id)`, `delete_upload(thread_id, filename)` | `{"success": true, "files": [...]}`, `{"files": [...], "count": N}` |
| Artifacts | `get_artifact(thread_id, path)` → `(bytes, mime_type)` | tuple |

**Key difference from Gateway**: Upload accepts local `Path` objects instead of HTTP `UploadFile`, rejects directory paths before copying, and reuses a single worker when document conversion must run inside an active event loop. Artifact returns `(bytes, mime_type)` instead of HTTP Response. The new Gateway-only thread cleanup route deletes `.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}` after LangGraph thread deletion; there is no matching `DeerFlowClient` method yet. `update_mcp_config()` and `update_skill()` automatically invalidate the cached agent.

**Tests**: `tests/test_client.py` (offline unit tests including
`TestGatewayConformance`), `tests/test_client_live.py` (live integration tests,
requires a root `config.yaml`, valid API credentials, and explicit opt-in via
`make test-live` or `DEER_FLOW_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`). The live suite calls real
external APIs and may incur API costs or create local sandboxes, artifacts, and
files. It is marked `live`, excluded from `make test`, and skipped in default
CI.

**Gateway Conformance Tests** (`TestGatewayConformance`): Validate that every dict-returning client method conforms to the corresponding Gateway Pydantic response model. Each test parses the client output through the Gateway model — if Gateway adds a required field that the client doesn't provide, Pydantic raises `ValidationError` and CI catches the drift. Covers: `ModelsListResponse`, `ModelResponse`, `SkillsListResponse`, `SkillResponse`, `SkillInstallResponse`, `McpConfigResponse`, `UploadResponse`, `MemoryConfigResponse`, `MemoryStatusResponse`.

### E2B Mount Uploads

The E2B provider uploads host mounts during sandbox creation. It passes binary file objects to the E2B SDK.

Each mount has these fixed limits:

- 100 MiB for one file.
- 512 MiB for all files.
- 2,000 files.

The full sandbox creation pass also allows 512 MiB and 2,000 files. Skill
projections and configured mounts share this budget.

The pass has a cooperative 120-second deadline. The provider checks it before
each mount, during directory preflight, and before each SDK write. The deadline
does not interrupt active filesystem or E2B SDK calls.

The provider checks mount limits before upload. It rechecks each opened file descriptor against its preflight size before SDK upload.

An invalid mount does not block later mounts.

Each successful upload logs its source, destination, file count, byte count, and elapsed time.

A stopped pass logs its limit reason and elapsed time. It reports attempted and completed upload totals separately.
