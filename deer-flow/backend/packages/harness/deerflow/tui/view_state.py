"""Pure view-state reducer for the DeerFlow TUI.

This module has **no** Textual / rendering dependency. It models the visible
conversation as an immutable list of typed rows and a small set of actions,
and exposes a single pure ``reduce(state, action) -> state`` function.

Keeping this layer pure makes the interesting behaviour (streaming deltas,
tool cards, error rows) testable with plain ``pytest`` and a handful of
synthetic actions, independent of any terminal.

The runtime bridge (``deerflow.tui.runtime``) is responsible for translating
``DeerFlowClient`` ``StreamEvent`` objects into these actions; the Textual app
renders ``ViewState`` into widgets. Both sides depend on this module, not on
each other.

    the most recent assistant row: on a thread with history, the client
    re-emits every prior message on each new turn (its dedup is per-turn), and
    a re-emitted *older* message can arrive after a newer one has started — so
    matching only the tail row would duplicate prior answers.

    An empty id ("" — some providers/paths never stamp per-chunk ids, see
    ``runtime._as_str``) is NOT a reliable key for that same scan: unlike a
    genuine id, it is shared by every id-less chunk from *every* turn, so

    new turn's text into whatever earlier turn's row happened to be id-less
    too — silently vanishing the new turn's answer into a stale row. Empty-id
    deltas are therefore routed to `_apply_assistant_delta_anonymous`, which
    tracks "this turn's" row by position instead of by id.

    Updates also merge by content rather than blindly concatenating, to absorb

    that never stamps per-chunk ids still streams token by token, e.g.
    ``"Hel"`` then ``"lo"`` — so the first empty-id delta of a turn starts a
    new row, and later empty-id deltas keep appending to that row (tracked by
    ``state.streaming_anonymous_row_index``, reset on every
    ``RunStarted``/``RunEnded``/``ClearRows``, not by id, so a later turn
    always starts its own new row instead of matching the previous turn's
    leftover id-less row — the bug this split exists to avoid).

    The tracked row is only reused while it is still the LAST row in the
    transcript. A genuine id naturally changes across a tool round-trip
    (LangGraph gives the post-tool continuation a new AIMessage id), which is
    why an interleaved ``ToolStarted``/``ToolResult`` already starts a new row
    in the id-keyed path (see `test_assistant_delta_with_new_id_after_tool_
    creates_separate_row`). An empty id has no such natural signal — it is
    always ``""`` before and after the tool call — so this function uses row
    *position* as the substitute: once anything else has been appended (a
    tool card, in practice), the anonymous row is no longer the tail, and the
