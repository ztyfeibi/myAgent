"""Slash-command registry for the DeerFlow TUI (pure).

Normalizes two command sources into one searchable list:

* **Built-ins** — TUI-owned affordances (``/help``, ``/model``, ``/threads`` …).
* **Skills** — one ``/<skill-name>`` per enabled skill, preserving DeerFlow's
  existing slash-skill activation semantics.

The picker filters this list; :func:`resolve` classifies a submitted line as a
built-in command, a skill activation, an unknown command, or a plain message.
No Textual dependency.
