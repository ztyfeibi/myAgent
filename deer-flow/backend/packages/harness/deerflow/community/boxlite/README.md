# BoxLite backend

Runs each DeerFlow sandbox as a [BoxLite](https://github.com/boxlite-ai/boxlite)
micro-VM — a daemonless, OCI-native VM with its own kernel (libkrun/KVM on Linux,
Hypervisor.framework on macOS). Motivated by the resource/cold-start pain with
the default AIO Docker sandbox in
[#3439](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/issues/3439) and
[#3213](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/issues/3213); discussion in
[#3936](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/issues/3936).

## Configuration

```yaml
sandbox:
  use: deerflow.community.boxlite:BoxliteProvider
  image: python:3.12-slim         # any OCI image (default: python:3.12-slim)
  memory_mib: 1024                # per-box memory cap (optional)
  cpus: 2                         # per-box vCPUs (optional)
  replicas: 3                     # active + warm VM cap per gateway process (default: 3)
  idle_timeout: 600               # warm VM idle seconds before stop; 0 disables
  health_check_skip_seconds: 0.0  # optional low-latency mode: skip reclaim
                                  #   health checks for recent releases; 0 keeps
                                  #   reliability-first validation (default: 0.0)
  environment:                    # injected into every command
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
```

Install the optional runtime before selecting this provider:

```bash
pip install "deerflow-harness[boxlite]"
```

The `boxlite` package is an optional DeerFlow harness extra, not part of the
default install. It is also limited to the host platforms and architectures
where BoxLite publishes wheels and can boot micro-VMs. Unsupported development
hosts, such as Windows, should use another sandbox provider or run DeerFlow from
a supported Linux/macOS environment.

**Host requirement:** BoxLite boots micro-VMs, so a Linux host needs KVM — i.e.
nested virtualization when DeerFlow runs inside a cloud VM. macOS uses
Hypervisor.framework. This is the main deployment constraint to weigh vs. the
container-based providers.

## Design

DeerFlow's `Sandbox` contract is synchronous; BoxLite's SDK is async-native and
its box handles are event-loop-affine. The provider owns **one** private asyncio
loop on a daemon thread and marshals every coroutine onto it via
`run_coroutine_threadsafe`. BoxLite boxes are named deterministically from
`user_id:thread_id`, released into an in-process warm pool after each agent turn,
and reclaimed by the same thread on the next acquire.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `provider.py` | `SandboxProvider` lifecycle + the private-loop bridge |
| `box.py`      | `Sandbox` adapter; `execute_command` + file ops |

## Contract coverage

The full `Sandbox` surface is implemented. File operations run as shell commands
inside the box and reuse `deerflow.sandbox.search`, mirroring `e2b_sandbox`:

- `execute_command` — `sh -lc`, with per-call env and timeout.
- `read_file` / `write_file` / `update_file` — `cat` and chunked `base64` (binary-safe, no arg-size limit).
- `download_file` — 100 MB cap, restricted to the `/mnt/user-data` prefix.
- `list_dir` / `glob` / `grep` — `find` / `grep` with busybox-portable flags; results filtered/capped in Python.

The provider creates `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}` and
`/mnt/skills` on box start so those virtual paths resolve natively.

Warm-pool capacity is governed by `sandbox.replicas` across active + warm VMs.
`sandbox.idle_timeout` controls how long released warm VMs stay running; `0`
disables idle reaping. Active boxes are never evicted to satisfy the cap.

## Status

Verified end-to-end against a live box (provider resolution → `execute_command`
→ file ops) on macOS/HVF. Linux/KVM validation and benchmarks vs. the AIO
sandbox are tracked in
[#3936](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/issues/3936).
