        Takes over from whichever instance served this thread last — the
        container is deterministic per (user, thread), so a turn routing here is
        a legitimate handover. The previous owner's next renewal reports LOST and
        it stops tracking the container without touching it.

        Deliberately **not** fail-open. Swallowing the error and handing the
        sandbox out anyway would leave it unowned while in active use, so a peer
        would see an orphan and reap it — the exact failure this store exists to
        stop. Callers must let this propagate.

        The intent mark is published **before** the round trip, and that ordering
        is the point. ``take()`` makes the takeover durable before it returns —
        on redis the server has committed the SET while the reply is still in
        flight — so bumping the epoch afterwards leaves a window where the store
        already says the container is ours but the guard still reads as though it
        were not. A renewal holding an older ``LOST`` walks straight through it,
        drops the maps, and closes the client this call is about to hand back, so
        acquire returns an id the provider no longer tracks and ``get()`` answers
        ``None``. A guard must become visible no later than the transition it
        guards; the epoch alone cannot, because it can only be written after the
        call that performs the transition returns.

        So the two marks cover the two halves and are both needed: the intent
        mark covers "an acquire is mid-flight", the epoch covers "an acquire

        """Keep *sandbox_id*'s teardown marker alive for as long as its stop runs.

        ``claim(..., for_destroy=True)`` writes the ``del:`` marker with the
        ordinary lease TTL, and normal ``renew()`` extends only ``own:`` while
        deliberately reporting a teardown as ``LOST``. Active and unhealthy
        destroy paths drop the sandbox from the maps ``_renew_owned_leases``
        iterates; the warm path keeps its entry visible until the stop succeeds,
        so ``_forget_lost_sandbox`` separately honours ``_local_teardown`` rather
        than misreading our own marker as a peer takeover. Without this heartbeat,
        a container stop that outlived the TTL let the marker lapse, a peer's
        ``take()`` succeeded against the still-running container, and the stop
        landed on the turn that had just been handed it — the very window the
        ``del:`` state exists to close, reopened by its own expiry.

        This is what the per-sandbox ``flock`` used to cover for free: a held lock
        cannot expire. A lease can, so the exclusion has to be held deliberately
        rather than assumed to outlast the work it guards. Reachable without an
        abnormal backend — the config schema bounds only ``renewal_interval_seconds``
        (> 0) and ``ttl_multiplier`` (>= 2), so a legal setting puts the TTL below a
        normal container stop, and ``LocalContainerBackend._stop_container`` passes
        no ``timeout`` to ``subprocess.run``, so a wedged daemon blocks unbounded
        even at the default 120s.

        The TTL stays finite on purpose: the heartbeat dies with the process, so a
        destroyer that crashes mid-stop still releases the container one TTL later
        instead of marking it undestroyable forever.

        The final release is the heartbeat's own last act, not the caller's. A
        refresh ``claim`` still in flight when the context exits (the socket
        timeout bounds it, but it can be mid-call) would otherwise land *after* a
        caller-side release and rewrite the ``del:`` marker on a container whose
        stop had already completed — stranding a fresh ``take()`` (or rolling back
        a fresh create) until the TTL. Releasing from inside the heartbeat, after
        its loop has stopped, sequences the release strictly after the last
        refresh, so no claim can follow it.

        Claiming for destroy is the exclusion against **peers**: the lease is
        marked as a teardown, so a concurrent acquire on another instance is
        refused and the container cannot be re-acquired between this decision and
        the stop. That pairing is what replaced the per-sandbox flock guard. A
        claim that fails — peer-owned or backend unavailable — fails closed and
        we do not destroy.

        It is *not* an exclusion against this process: `claim()` succeeds against
        our own `own:` lease, so a same-process reclaim that ran before it wins
        the container and this stop lands on a turn already using it. The
        reservation is that half, and it is taken before the claim — after it,
        the entry stays visible in `_warm_pool` for the whole stop, so a reclaim
        would otherwise still find it.

        ``still_reapable`` is required rather than defaulting to unconditional:
        the safe default is the one that makes a new call site think about it,
        and this signature deliberately diverges from ``WarmPoolLifecycleMixin``'s
        hook for that reason. Safe because this provider overrides both mixin
        callers (``_evict_oldest_warm`` / ``_reap_expired_warm``); if those
        overrides were ever dropped, the mixin's call would fail loudly here
        rather than silently reopen the window.

        Returns:
            ``True`` when the container was stopped and the caller should drop
            its warm-pool entry; ``False`` when it is still running.

        on it is a cross-instance kill that interrupts an active turn (#4248).

        Claim the teardown lease first so this reap path is gated by the same
        ownership guard as every other destroy (``_destroy_warm_entry``,
        ``_drop_unhealthy_reserved``); fail closed (leave the container for the
        peer to reap via its own reconciliation) if a peer already owns it or
        the ownership store cannot answer.

        The claim alone is only the cross-**instance** half: it succeeds against
        our own lease by design, so it says nothing about this process. The
        same-process half is the local teardown reservation, taken first and
        held across the whole path — between the readiness timeout and the
        claim, ``_reconcile_orphans`` (idle checker, every 60s) can see this
        container running, untracked, and past its recovery grace, and park it
        in ``_warm_pool``; the subsequent claim would still succeed and the
        stop would land on an entry this instance has just adopted, leaving a
        dead warm entry for the next reclaim to hand out. The predicate checks
        the id is absent from both the active and warm maps; the reservation
        makes that check and the teardown mark one critical section, so no
        adopt/acquire can slip between them (same pairing as
        ``_destroy_warm_entry``).
