"""update_agent tool — let a custom agent persist updates to its own SOUL.md / config.

Bound to the lead agent only when ``runtime.context['agent_name']`` is set
(i.e. inside an existing custom agent's chat). The default agent does not see
this tool, and the bootstrap flow continues to use ``setup_agent`` for the
initial creation handshake.

The tool writes back through the configured agent store (file: per-user
``config.yaml``/``SOUL.md``; db: the shared ``agents`` table) so an agent created
by one user is never visible to (or mutable by) another.

Cross-field write atomicity depends on the backend: the ``db`` store commits
config and soul in a single transaction, so a partial failure never leaves one
updated and the other stale. The ``file`` store stages both to temp files and
commits them with two sequential ``os.replace`` calls (see
``FileAgentStore._write``): each file is all-or-nothing, but a crash *between*
the two replaces can leave a freshly-written config.yaml beside a stale SOUL.md
(single-node, sub-millisecond window). The pre-store tool reported that partial
window explicitly ("Partial update for agent 'X': ..."); routing through the
store drops the *reporting* (a mid-replace crash now surfaces as the generic
"Failed to update agent"). That is an intentional tradeoff — the stage-then-
replace *safety* is preserved (no corruption, no leftover temp files), only the
diagnostic is gone. If cross-file atomicity ever matters on ``file``, restore
that reporting in ``FileAgentStore._write``.

    Use this when the user asks to refine the agent's identity, description,

    Pass ``skills=[]`` to disable all skills for this agent. Omit ``skills``
