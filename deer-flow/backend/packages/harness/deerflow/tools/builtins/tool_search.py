"""Tool search — deferred tool discovery at runtime.

Contains:
- DeferredToolCatalog: immutable, searchable catalog of deferred tools.
- build_tool_search_tool: builds the `tool_search` tool as a closure over a
  catalog; it records promotions into graph state via ``Command``.
- build_deferred_tool_setup: assembles the catalog + tool from the tools
  configured for this agent build.
- build_mcp_routing_middleware: builds the PR2 auto-promote middleware from
  serialized routing metadata on deferred tools available to the caller.

The agent sees deferred tool names in <available-deferred-tools> but cannot
call them until it fetches their full schema via the tool_search tool. The
deferred set rides on a build-time closure and promotion lives in per-thread
graph state — there is no ContextVar. Source-agnostic: a tool is "deferred"
when it carries the ``deerflow_mcp`` metadata tag.
