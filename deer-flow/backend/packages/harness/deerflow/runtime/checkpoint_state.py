"""Materialized checkpoint-state access and state-only mutation graphs.

:class:`CheckpointStateAccessor` is the single choke point for thread
checkpoint-state reads and writes. It binds a compiled graph (which carries
the mode-matched channel schema), a checkpointer, and the frozen channel mode:
every operation injects the mode marker into the config and passes the
compatibility gate before touching state. Delta checkpoints store no full
``channel_values`` — raw saver reads see sentinels — so consumers must go
through this accessor instead of calling the checkpointer directly.

:func:`build_state_mutation_graph` compiles a state-only graph (one no-op
node, entry = finish) for wholesale state replacement such as rollback
restore and context compaction: it shares the agent graph's checkpoint
machinery but schedules no pending nodes, so the written head stays idle.
