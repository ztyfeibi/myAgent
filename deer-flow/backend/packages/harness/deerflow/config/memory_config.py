"""Configuration for the memory mechanism (host-shared fields only).

DeerMem-private fields live in ``backends/deermem/config.py`` (``DeerMemConfig``),
reached via ``backend_config`` (a dict the factory passes to the backend's
``__init__``). This module holds ONLY the host-shared fields every backend /
call site / factory reads: ``enabled`` / ``injection_enabled`` /
``shutdown_flush_timeout_seconds`` / ``manager_class`` / ``backend_config``.
Keeping the shared schema slim is what
makes backends swappable and portable (DeerMem's knobs do not leak onto the
shared contract).
