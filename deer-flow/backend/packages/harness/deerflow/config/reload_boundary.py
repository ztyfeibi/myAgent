"""Single source of truth for the config hot-reload boundary.

Bytedance/deer-flow issue #3144: gateway request dependencies resolve
``AppConfig`` through ``get_app_config()`` on every request, so per-run
fields take effect on the next message without restarting the gateway.
The fields listed in this module are the **infrastructure** subset that
the gateway captures once at startup — engines, singletons, IM clients,
the logging handler — and that therefore require a process restart to
change at runtime.

The registry covers two kinds of entries:

- Top-level ``AppConfig`` fields (``database``, ``checkpointer``,
  ``run_events``, ``stream_bridge``, ``sandbox``, ``log_level``). For
  these, :func:`format_field_description` produces the standardised
  ``"startup-only: ..."`` prefix that the matching Pydantic
  ``Field(description=...)`` carries, so the boundary surfaces in IDE
  hover next to the field itself.
- Top-level ``config.yaml`` sections that are not part of the
  ``AppConfig`` schema (``channels``). These cannot be standardised at
  the schema level, so the registry is their only canonical location.

Any future "needs restart" scanner — operator tooling, lint hooks, doc
generators — should drive off this registry rather than re-parsing
prose.
