"""Hybrid schema bootstrap for DeerFlow's application tables.

Replaces the unconditional ``Base.metadata.create_all`` at Gateway startup.
Combines two ideas:

1. ``create_all`` stays the empty-DB fast path -- it renders ``Base.metadata``
   faithfully across SQLite and Postgres dialects (JSON vs JSONB, server
   defaults, index/FK names, type affinity) without anyone having to hand-keep
   a mirror baseline in sync with the models.
2. **Alembic owns every change from baseline onward.** Any new ORM column /
   table / index must ship as a revision under ``migrations/versions/``.

Three-branch decision (see ``_decide_state``)
---------------------------------------------

| DB state                              | Action                                  |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| empty (no DeerFlow tables)            | ``create_all`` + ``alembic stamp head`` |
| legacy (DeerFlow tables, no alembic)  | ``create_all`` (baseline tables only, as backfill) + ``stamp 0001_baseline`` + ``upgrade head`` |
| versioned (``alembic_version`` row)   | ``alembic upgrade head``                |

The legacy branch handles pre-alembic databases that already have at least one
DeerFlow-owned table. ``create_all`` runs first because stamping at
``0001_baseline`` makes alembic skip the baseline's own ``create_table`` DDL on
the subsequent upgrade -- so any baseline table introduced into
``Base.metadata`` after the user's DB was first provisioned (e.g. the
``channel_*`` tables from PR #1930 for users upgrading across multiple
releases) would otherwise never be created, and the first request hitting that
table would 500 with ``no such table``. The backfill is **restricted to
``_BASELINE_TABLE_NAMES``** so it does not also create tables that future
revisions introduce -- those revisions' own ``op.create_table`` would then
fail with ``relation already exists``. A guard test pins the restriction
set against ``0001_baseline.upgrade()``'s actual output.

Column-level shape (the pre-#3658 vs post-#3658 vs manual-ALTER cases for
``token_usage_by_model``) is answered by each ``versions/*.py`` revision via
the idempotent helpers in ``migrations/_helpers.py`` (``safe_add_column``
no-ops when the column is already present and ``logger.warning``s on
shape drift). Future schema additions therefore plug in by writing a new
revision file -- **no edit to this module is required** *unless* the new
revision creates a new baseline table, in which case ``_BASELINE_TABLE_NAMES``
must be updated to match (the guard test fires otherwise).

Concurrency safety
------------------

Layered, with different guarantees per backend. Postgres has true
cross-process serialisation. SQLite is single-process safe and cross-process
best-effort; multi-instance deployments should use Postgres.

* **Postgres -- true cross-process serialisation.** ``pg_advisory_lock`` runs
  the whole reflect-and-act sequence under an exclusive lock that survives
  cross-process. Concurrent Gateway instances queue cleanly and the second
  one observes head as a no-op.

* **SQLite -- single-process serialisation, best-effort cross-process.**
  SQLite is single-node by deployment, so the realistic concurrency case is
  multiple async tasks inside one Gateway process (tests, lifespan re-entry).
  A per-engine ``asyncio.Lock`` serialises those. For the rare cross-process
  case (e.g. two ``make dev`` workers on the same DB file), we rely on
  SQLite's own file-level write lock plus a 30s ``PRAGMA busy_timeout`` --
  the latter is set on **both** the production engine
  (``persistence/engine.py``) and the alembic-spawned engine
  (``migrations/env.py``) so any writer waits up to 30s for the file lock
  instead of failing fast. This is best-effort, not a true mutex: under
  pathological overlap a process can still see ``database is locked`` after
  30s. The fallback line of defence -- idempotent revisions -- guarantees
  correctness anyway.

* **Idempotent revisions -- retry fallback.** Column revisions use the helpers
  in ``migrations/_helpers.py`` so repeated post-baseline changes, manual
  ALTERs, or retries after SQLite lock contention do not duplicate work.

``alembic upgrade head`` on a DB already at head is a no-op by alembic's own
semantics, so the second-N-th actor simply observes head and exits.

    Defence: ``SET LOCAL idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0`` disables
