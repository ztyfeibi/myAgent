"""Abstract interface for custom agent definition storage.

Two implementations:
- :class:`FileAgentStore` — the historical per-user on-disk layout
  (``config.yaml`` + ``SOUL.md``), still the default and behaviourally
  unchanged.
- :class:`SqlAgentStore` — a row per agent in the shared SQL persistence
  layer, so every node in a multi-instance deployment sees the same agents.

The store is deliberately **synchronous**. Its consumers — the LangGraph graph
factory (``make_lead_agent``), the ``setup_agent`` / ``update_agent`` tools, and
the GitHub agent registry — are synchronous and may run on the event loop or in
a separate process from the gateway, where an async engine cannot be driven.
Async HTTP routes call the store via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (the same pattern the
agents router already uses for filesystem work).

``user_id`` semantics (kept identical to the pre-refactor free functions in
:mod:`deerflow.config.agents_config`, which is what makes the file backend a
behaviour-neutral move): ``None`` resolves to the effective user from the
request context — ``"default"`` in no-auth mode — via
:func:`deerflow.runtime.user_context.get_effective_user_id`. This is filesystem
bucket semantics, distinct from the AUTO/None sentinel used by the async
``thread_meta`` repositories.
