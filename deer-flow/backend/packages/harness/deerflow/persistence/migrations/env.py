"""Alembic environment for DeerFlow application tables.

ONLY manages DeerFlow's tables (runs, threads_meta, feedback, users,
run_events, channel_connections, channel_credentials, channel_oauth_states,
channel_conversations).

LangGraph's checkpointer tables (``checkpoints``, ``checkpoint_blobs``,
``checkpoint_writes``, ``checkpoint_migrations``) are managed by LangGraph
itself -- they have their own schema lifecycle and must not be touched by
Alembic. The ``include_object`` filter below explicitly excludes them so a
future ``alembic revision --autogenerate`` will not emit ``drop_table`` for
tables it does not own.
