# GitHub Event-Driven Agents

GitHub is a **webhook-push** channel: there is no long-polling worker. Every GitHub App / repository delivery lands at `POST /api/webhooks/github`, where it is HMAC-verified, fan-out'd to one `InboundMessage` per matching custom-agent binding, and shipped to the rest of DeerFlow through the same `ChannelManager` that handles Feishu/Slack/Telegram. For the high-level orientation, see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) → "GitHub event-driven agents".

This document covers the **architecture** of that pipeline:

- Per-agent bindings (`config.yaml` → `github:` block)
- Webhook → fan-out → `InboundMessage` dispatch
- Mention-handle precedence for `require_mention` triggers
- `preferred_thread_id = UUID5(repo, number, agent_name)` thread determinism
- GH token lifecycle (`GITHUB_APP_ID` + `PRIVATE_KEY` → `run_context["github_token"]` → sandbox `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- `ConflictError` (HTTP 409) thread-create race recovery
- Why **outbound is log-only** (agents post via `gh` from their sandbox)
- Follow-up buffering while busy (issue #4121): buffer → watch → drain, and the single-process scope limit

## Overview

GitHub bindings are declared **per custom agent** in `users/{owner_user_id}/agents/{agent_name}/config.yaml` under a `github:` block. The global `config.yaml` `channels.github` block is intentionally minimal — only the operator kill-switch (`enabled`) and `default_mention_login` live there. Everything that identifies "which agent handles which repo" lives next to the agent that owns it.

    Webhook["POST /api/webhooks/github<br/>(HMAC verify)"]:::route

    OperatorYaml --> Registry
    AgentYaml --> Registry
    Registry --> Webhook
```

Registry cache invalidation uses the configured agent store's opaque signature.
The file backend derives it from agent config mtimes; the database backend uses
a deterministic digest of the stored owner, name, config, and soul, so an update
still invalidates the registry when two writes share the same timestamp.

Each agent binding lists the **events it cares about** under `triggers:`. Events absent from `triggers:` are not delivered to that agent — the dispatcher never loads the agent for them. `DEFAULT_TRIGGERS` only supplies **field-level defaults** (e.g. `require_mention: true`) for events a binding did declare; it is no longer an enablement list.

## Webhook → Fan-out → Dispatch

The webhook handler stays cheap — no LangGraph calls — so GitHub's 10-second delivery timeout is never at risk. Verification, fan-out, and the bus publish are all in-process and bounded.

## `preferred_thread_id = UUID5(...)` Thread Determinism

`resolve_thread_id(repo, issue_or_pr_number, agent_name)` builds a deterministic LangGraph thread id so a `(repo, PR/issue number)` always lands on the same thread — even after a store wipe, even across gateway replicas (same UUID5 namespace).

```mermaid
graph LR
    classDef input fill:#D8CFC4,stroke:#6E6259,color:#2F2A26
    classDef hash fill:#D7D3E8,stroke:#6B6680,color:#29263A
    classDef thread fill:#C9D7D2,stroke:#5D706A,color:#21302C

    Repo["repo<br/>owner/name"]:::input
    Number["issue/PR number<br/>int"]:::input
    Agent["agent_name<br/>[A-Za-z0-9-]+"]:::input
    Seed["seed = '{repo}#{number}:{agent}'"]:::hash
    UUID5["uuid.uuid5(<br/>  GITHUB_THREAD_NAMESPACE,<br/>  seed)"]:::hash
    Thread["thread_id<br/>(same across replicas + restarts)"]:::thread

    Repo --> Seed
    Number --> Seed
    Agent --> Seed
    Seed --> UUID5 --> Thread
```

Different agents on the same PR (coder + reviewer) **deliberately** get different thread ids — `agent_name` is part of the seed. Sharing a thread would couple their message histories and checkpoints, and `multitask_strategy="reject"` would silently drop one run on every dual-mention. Each agent owns its own thread; cross-agent coordination flows through GitHub (PR comments, review threads), the source of truth humans see.

`ChannelStore` uses `topic_id = f"{number}:{agent_name}"` as its cache key, so each agent's cached mapping is independent — a coder's mapping is invisible to a reviewer on the same PR.

## Mention-handle Precedence

For bindings that declare `require_mention: true` on a given event, the dispatcher must resolve **which** mention login gates the trigger. The precedence chain is:

```mermaid
graph LR
    classDef step fill:#C9D7D2,stroke:#5D706A,color:#21302C
    classDef fallback fill:#D7D3E8,stroke:#6B6680,color:#29263A

    A["1. trigger.mention_login<br/>(per-event override)"]:::step
    B["2. github.bot_login<br/>(agent's App identity)"]:::step
    C["3. channels.github.default_mention_login<br/>(operator-wide default)"]:::step
    D["4. agent.name<br/>(last-resort fallback)"]:::fallback
    Use["effective @mention"]:::step

    A -->|"non-empty"| Use
    B -->|"non-empty"| Use
    C -->|"non-empty"| Use
    D --> Use
```

Whitespace-only values at every level are treated as unset, so the chain falls through cleanly. The `_is_self_event` gate uses the same precedence (with the agent's whole `bindings[*].triggers[*].mention_login` aggregated across all bindings, plus an `agent.name` fallback) so the self-loop gate and the mention gate stay coherent.

## GH Token Lifecycle

GitHub Agents get push/write credentials as **per-call installation tokens**, not as inherited environment. The minted token string is bound into `run_context["github_token"]` on the bus-consumer side and exposed to the agent's sandbox commands as both `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` via per-call `extra_env` on `execute_command`. No `os.environ` mutation, no cross-repo bleed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Bus as MessageBus
    participant Mgr as ChannelManager<br/>_handle_chat_on_thread
    participant Pol as inject_github_credentials()<br/>(github/run_policy.py)
    participant Auth as mint_installation_token<br/>(github/app_auth.py)
    participant GH as GitHub API<br/>(POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens)
    participant Run as runs.create
    participant GW as Gateway runtime
    participant Bash as bash_tool
    participant Sandbox as Sandbox process
    participant Cmd as Sandbox command<br/>(gh / git push)

    Bus->>Mgr: msg (channel=github, metadata.github.installation_id)
    Mgr->>Pol: _apply_channel_policy(msg, run_context)
    Pol->>Auth: mint_installation_token(installation_id)
    Auth->>GH: exchange installation_id for token<br/>(JWT signed with PRIVATE_KEY)
    GH-->>Auth: {token, expires_at}
    Auth-->>Pol: token string (cached ~55min)
    Pol->>Mgr: run_context["github_token"] = token
    Mgr->>Run: client.runs.create(<br/>thread_id, assistant_id,<br/>context={..., github_token})
    Run->>GW: POST /threads/{id}/runs
    GW-->>Run: pending
    Run-->>Mgr: returns once pending
    Note over Mgr: Manager returns immediately (fire_and_forget)

    Note over GW,Bash: Harness side
    GW->>Bash: bash_tool call<br/>cmd="git push https://x-access-token:$GH_TOKEN@..."
    Bash->>Sandbox: execute_command(<br/>env={"GH_TOKEN": "...",<br/>     "GITHUB_TOKEN": "..."})
    Note over Sandbox: AioSandbox: bash.exec(env=...) on fresh session<br/>LocalSandbox: subprocess.run(env=...)
    Sandbox->>Cmd: gh pr comment / git push / etc.
    Cmd->>GH: authenticated GitHub API call
```

Why a string and not a closure: `run_context` is JSON-encoded by the `langgraph_sdk` HTTP client before reaching Gateway. A Python callable does not survive that serialization. The harness side (`_github_env_from_runtime`) already accepts either shape, but only `str` round-trips through the SDK transport.

**Token TTL caveat**: GitHub installation tokens are valid for ~1 hour. Most agent runs finish well inside that window. Truly long coder runs (multi-hour refactors at the higher `recursion_limit=250` ceiling) may see a 401 on a late `git push` / `gh pr create`. Auto-refresh past the 1h TTL is intentionally deferred — it requires registering a token-provider lookup on the harness side, which crosses the harness/app boundary (`tests/test_harness_boundary.py`). Until refresh ships, long runs should finish GitHub writes before expiry or accept the loss. If minting fails (bad App id, wrong installation_id, missing private key), the agent still runs without push/write credentials — read-only is better than no response.

## Thread-create Race Recovery

Two webhook deliveries for the same `(repo, number)` can land within milliseconds of each other and race on `threads.create(thread_id=preferred_thread_id)`. The recovery is narrow by design.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Mgr1 as ChannelManager<br/>(delivery 1)
    participant Mgr2 as ChannelManager<br/>(delivery 2)
    participant Client as langgraph_sdk client
    participant Gateway as Gateway<br/>threads.create

    par concurrent deliveries
        Mgr1->>Client: client.threads.create(thread_id=preferred)
        Client->>Gateway: POST /threads {thread_id}
    and
        Mgr2->>Client: client.threads.create(thread_id=preferred)
        Client->>Gateway: POST /threads {thread_id}
    end

    Gateway-->>Client: 200 OK (first writer wins)
    Gateway-->>Client: 409 ConflictError (second writer)

    Client-->>Mgr1: thread (created)
    Client-->>Mgr2: ConflictError

    Note over Mgr2: Recovery branch
    Mgr2->>Client: threads.get(preferred_thread_id)
    alt existing
        Client-->>Mgr2: thread
        Mgr2->>Mgr2: _store_thread_id(msg, preferred_thread_id)
        Mgr2-->>Mgr2: reuse deterministic id
    else also missing
        Client-->>Mgr2: error
        Mgr2->>Mgr2: raise (do NOT cache the mapping)
    end
```

The recovery is **narrow**: only `langgraph_sdk.errors.ConflictError` (HTTP 409) is treated as a concurrent-create collision. Any other failure (transient DB outage, network error, 5xx) propagates so the delivery can fail/retry rather than silently caching `preferred_thread_id` into the store and mapping every future webhook on this issue/PR to a thread that was never created (every later run would 404 forever with no retry path).

The follow-up `threads.get(preferred_thread_id)` is itself verified before caching — if it also rejects, the store underneath is in an inconsistent state and the failure surfaces.

## Follow-up Buffering While Busy (#4121)

A **different** conflict from the one above: not two deliveries racing to *create* a thread, but a new comment arriving while a *run* is already active on an existing thread. `runs.create()` raises `ConflictError` for that too, and until this fix the manager only logged it and replied with `THREAD_BUSY_MESSAGE` — invisible to the commenter, since `GitHubChannel.send()` is log-only (see below). The comment looked silently ignored.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C1 as Comment 1
    participant C2 as Comment 2 (while busy)
    participant Mgr as ChannelManager
    participant Client as langgraph_sdk client
    participant SB as StreamBridge

    C1->>Mgr: InboundMessage
    Mgr->>Client: runs.create() [fire_and_forget]
    Client-->>Mgr: {run_id: run-1, status: pending}
    Mgr->>SB: subscribe(run-1) (background watcher)

    C2->>Mgr: InboundMessage (same thread_id)
    Mgr->>Client: runs.create()
    Client-->>Mgr: 409 ConflictError
    Mgr->>Mgr: _buffer_followup(thread_id, msg)<br/>(deduped by delivery_id, capped at 20)
    Mgr-->>C2: THREAD_BUSY_MESSAGE (log-only on GitHub)

    Note over SB: run-1 completes
    SB-->>Mgr: END_SENTINEL
    Mgr->>Mgr: _drain_followups_for_thread()<br/>(pop up to 10, oldest first)
    Mgr->>Client: runs.create() with <followups-while-busy> input
    Client-->>Mgr: {run_id: run-2, status: pending}
    Mgr->>SB: subscribe(run-2) (watch again — chains if >10 queued)
```

Key properties:

- **Dedupe**: buffering keys on the GitHub webhook delivery id (falling back to the generic provider-message-id metadata keys, mirroring `_inbound_dedupe_key`), so a redelivered webhook for a comment already buffered is a no-op rather than a duplicate entry.
- **Cap**: 20 entries per thread. Overflow drops the *oldest* buffered entry (not the newest) with a WARNING log — recent activity is a more useful signal than the stalest queued comment once a thread is deep enough in the backlog to hit the cap. No reaction/acknowledgment is sent on drop; see the reactions note below.
- **Batching**: a drain coalesces at most 10 entries into one `<followups-while-busy>` input block. A backlog deeper than 10 is not force-fit into a single turn — the drained run is itself watched, so its own completion triggers another drain cycle for the remainder.
- **Drain-conflict edge case**: if the drain's own `runs.create()` also hits `ConflictError` — e.g. a manual Web UI turn or a scheduled run raced onto the same thread — the popped batch is requeued (not lost, not retried in a tight loop). It is picked up again the next time this manager successfully creates *and watches* a run on that thread, which is guaranteed to eventually happen once whatever is occupying the thread finishes and any subsequent trigger succeeds.
- **Reactions are out of scope for this slice.** GitHub's reaction API (`eyes`/`confused` acknowledgment) has no existing integration in this codebase and needs its own design pass; buffered comments are coalesced silently, with no per-comment acknowledgment.
- **Config**: gated behind `ChannelRunPolicy.buffer_followups_on_busy` (default `False`); GitHub's own registration in `app/gateway/github/run_policy.py` opts in, since it is exactly the fire_and_forget + log-only-send channel this was designed for. Any other channel that adopts `fire_and_forget=True` in the future keeps the old silent-drop-with-log behavior unless it opts in too.
- **Plumbing**: the watcher subscribes to the Gateway's `StreamBridge` singleton (`app.state.stream_bridge`), which `ChannelManager` previously had no way to reach — every other consumer gets it via `get_stream_bridge(request)`, which needs an HTTP `Request` the bus-consumer loop doesn't have. It is threaded as a zero-arg closure from `app.py`'s lifespan (`get_stream_bridge=lambda: getattr(app.state, "stream_bridge", None)`) through `start_channel_service()` → `ChannelService.__init__` → `ChannelManager.__init__`, mirroring the existing `launch_run=lambda **kwargs: launch_scheduled_thread_run(app=app, **kwargs)` closure already used for `ScheduledTaskService` in the same lifespan function.
- **Single-process scope (known limitation)**: the buffer and watcher tasks live in one `ChannelManager` instance's process memory. Under `GATEWAY_WORKERS>1` or a multi-pod deployment, a follow-up comment that a load balancer or webhook fan-out routes to a *different* worker than the one that created the busy run will not see that worker's buffer. This mirrors the cross-pod gap already documented for issue #4120 (IM leader election or a shared buffer store would close it) and is deliberately deferred — single-process/single-pod deployments, the safe default, are unaffected.

## Outbound is Log-only

    Log["gateway.log<br/>(INFO line)"]:::send

    Run -->|"mid-run intentional writeback"| GhCLI --> Issue
    Run -->|"final assistant message"| Channel --> Log
```

GitHub agents post to GitHub themselves via the `gh` CLI from inside their sandbox (`gh issue comment`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr create`, etc.). The channel's `send()` is **log-only** by design — the agent's final assistant message is logged at INFO for visibility but never auto-posted.

Why:

- **Multiple agents can bind the same event.** coder + reviewer on a mention would each auto-post a reply, producing two replies per mention even when only one had useful work. Letting the LLM call `gh` mid-run means silence is just "the LLM did not call `gh`".
- **The agent often wants to post intermediate updates** (an issue comment linking the PR, a sub-issue comment, a PR description edit). The auto-post-the-final-message contract didn't model that and forced the final message to play double duty.
- **The dispatcher's per-agent `_is_self_event` gate** already prevents comments the LLM posts via `gh` from looping the webhook back into a new run for the same agent.

This is also why the GitHub channel registers `ChannelRunPolicy.fire_and_forget=True`: the manager calls `runs.create()` and returns once the run is `pending`, no outbound ferrying, no SDK 300s `httpx.ReadTimeout` on a legitimate long coder run.
