# Conversation Summarization

DeerFlow includes automatic conversation summarization to handle long conversations that approach model token limits. When enabled, the system automatically condenses older messages while preserving recent context.

New checkpoints no longer use raw task-result or skill-read transcript content to derive durable context. The capture path consumes bounded structured metadata stamped on the corresponding `ToolMessage.additional_kwargs`; transcript text remains display/model content, not the state-capture protocol.

## Overview

The summarization feature uses LangChain's `SummarizationMiddleware` to monitor conversation history and trigger summarization based on configurable thresholds. When activated, it:

1. Monitors message token counts in real-time
2. Triggers summarization when thresholds are met
3. Keeps recent messages intact while summarizing older exchanges
4. Maintains AI/Tool message pairs together for context continuity
5. Stores the summary in `ThreadState.summary_text` and projects it ephemerally through durable context data

## Configuration

Summarization is configured in `config.yaml` under the `summarization` key:

```yaml
summarization:
  enabled: true
  model_name: null  # null = summarize with the run's own model (see below); or name a lightweight model

  # Trigger conditions (OR logic - any condition triggers summarization)
  trigger:
    - type: tokens
      value: 4000
    # Additional triggers (optional)
    # - type: messages
    #   value: 50
    # - type: fraction
    #   value: 0.8  # 80% of model's max input tokens

  # Context retention policy
  keep:
    type: messages
    value: 20

  # Token trimming for summarization call
  trim_tokens_to_summarize: 4000

  # Custom summary prompt (optional)
  summary_prompt: null

  # Tool names treated as skill file reads for the durable skill_context channel
  skill_file_read_tool_names:
    - read_file
    - read
    - view
    - cat
```

### Configuration Options

#### `enabled`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Enable or disable automatic summarization

#### `model_name`
- **Type**: String or null
- **Default**: `null`
- **Description**: Model to use for generating summaries.
  - **`null` (model ownership)**: summarize with the model the run actually executes with — the lead run's resolved model, a subagent's own model, or a thread's custom-agent model — **not** `config.models[0]`. This keeps compaction working on a run whose model is healthy even when `models[0]`'s provider is broken (expired key, quota, outage).
  - **Set to a model name**: that model generates summaries. If its provider fails, compaction **falls back to the run's own model** so a broken summary provider cannot disable compaction while a working model is available. Recommended to use a lightweight, cost-effective model like `gpt-4o-mini` or equivalent.
  - Ownership applies to all three paths — automatic lead compaction, subagent compaction, and manual `/compact`. Manual `/compact` resolves the run model with the same precedence as a normal run: the model selected for the request (`POST /api/threads/{id}/compact` body `model_name`, sent by the frontend from the composer's current model) → the thread's custom-agent model → the default. A whitespace-only summary response is treated as a generation failure (it is never committed as a valid empty summary).

#### `trigger`
- **Type**: Single `ContextSize` or list of `ContextSize` objects
- **Required**: At least one trigger must be specified when enabled
- **Description**: Thresholds that trigger summarization. Uses OR logic - summarization runs when ANY threshold is met.

**ContextSize Types:**

1. **Token-based trigger**: Activates when token count reaches the specified value
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     type: tokens
     value: 4000
   ```

2. **Message-based trigger**: Activates when message count reaches the specified value
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     type: messages
     value: 50
   ```

3. **Fraction-based trigger**: Activates when token usage reaches a percentage of the model's maximum input tokens
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     type: fraction
     value: 0.8  # 80% of max input tokens
   ```

**Multiple Triggers:**
```yaml
trigger:
  - type: tokens
    value: 4000
  - type: messages
    value: 50
```

#### `keep`
- **Type**: `ContextSize` object
- **Default**: `{type: messages, value: 20}`
- **Description**: Specifies how much recent conversation history to preserve after summarization.

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Keep most recent 20 messages
keep:
  type: messages
  value: 20

# Keep most recent 3000 tokens
keep:
  type: tokens
  value: 3000

# Keep most recent 30% of model's max input tokens
keep:
  type: fraction
  value: 0.3
```

#### `trim_tokens_to_summarize`
- **Type**: Integer or null
- **Default**: `4000`
- **Description**: Maximum tokens to include when preparing messages for the summarization call itself. Set to `null` to skip trimming (not recommended for very long conversations).

#### `summary_prompt`
- **Type**: String or null
- **Default**: `null` (uses LangChain's default prompt)
- **Description**: Custom prompt template for generating summaries. The prompt should guide the model to extract the most important context.

#### `skill_file_read_tool_names`
- **Type**: List of strings
- **Default**: `["read_file", "read", "view", "cat"]`
- **Description**: Tool names treated as skill file reads when `DurableContextMiddleware` captures loaded skills into the checkpointed `skill_context` channel. A tool call is captured only when its name appears in this list and its target path is under `skills.container_path`. Set this list to `[]` to disable durable skill-reference capture.

Legacy `preserve_recent_skill_*` settings are no longer used. Loaded skill retention is handled by the durable `skill_context` reference channel instead of by preserving raw skill-read messages in the summarization window.

**Default Prompt Behavior:**
The default LangChain prompt instructs the model to:
- Extract highest quality/most relevant context
- Focus on information critical to the overall goal
- Avoid repeating completed actions
- Return only the extracted context

## How It Works

### Summarization Flow

1. **Monitoring**: Before each model call, the middleware counts tokens in the message history plus the existing `summary_text`, because both are projected into the next model request
2. **Trigger Check**: If any configured threshold is met, summarization is triggered
3. **Message Partitioning**: Messages are split into:
   - Messages to summarize (older messages beyond the `keep` threshold)
   - Messages to preserve (recent messages within the `keep` threshold)
4. **Summary Generation**: The model generates a concise summary of the older messages
5. **Context Replacement**: The message history is updated:
   - All old messages are removed
   - Recent messages are preserved
   - The generated prose summary is stored in `summary_text`
6. **AI/Tool Pair Protection**: The system ensures AI messages and their corresponding tool messages stay together
7. **Skill context channel**: Skill files read during the conversation (tool calls whose name is in `skill_file_read_tool_names` and whose path is under `skills.container_path`, narrowed to `.../SKILL.md`) are stamped with `skill_context_entry` metadata at the read-tool boundary, then captured by `DurableContextMiddleware` into the checkpointed `skill_context` channel as references: `name`, `path`, a one-line `description` parsed in-memory from the file's frontmatter, and `loaded_at`, deduped by path. On every model call they are rendered into a hidden durable-context data message as a compact "active skills" reminder that points at each `SKILL.md` for on-demand re-read, so which skills are active survives summarization without persisting or re-injecting the verbatim body. The channel keeps the most recently read skills (cap `_SKILL_CONTEXT_MAX_ENTRIES`; re-reading an existing skill refreshes its recency); sessions typically load only 1-3.

### Token Counting

- Uses approximate token counting based on character count
- For Anthropic models: ~3.3 characters per token
- For other models: Uses LangChain's default estimation
- Can be customized with a custom `token_counter` function

### Message Preservation

The middleware intelligently preserves message context:

- **Recent Messages**: Always kept intact based on `keep` configuration
- **AI/Tool Pairs**: Never split - if a cutoff point falls within tool messages, the system adjusts to keep the entire AI + Tool message sequence together
- **Summary Format**: Summary prose is stored in `summary_text` and rendered into an ephemeral hidden durable-context data message. Static handling rules live in a separate system message; summary text and other user/tool/model-derived values stay in the lower-authority data message.

## Best Practices

### Choosing Trigger Thresholds

1. **Token-based triggers**: Recommended for most use cases
   - Set to 60-80% of your model's context window
   - Example: For 8K context, use 4000-6000 tokens

2. **Message-based triggers**: Useful for controlling conversation length
   - Good for applications with many short messages
   - Example: 50-100 messages depending on average message length

3. **Fraction-based triggers**: Ideal when using multiple models
   - Automatically adapts to each model's capacity
   - Example: 0.8 (80% of model's max input tokens)

### Choosing Retention Policy (`keep`)

1. **Message-based retention**: Best for most scenarios
   - Preserves natural conversation flow
   - Recommended: 15-25 messages

2. **Token-based retention**: Use when precise control is needed
   - Good for managing exact token budgets
   - Recommended: 2000-4000 tokens

3. **Fraction-based retention**: For multi-model setups
   - Automatically scales with model capacity
   - Recommended: 0.2-0.4 (20-40% of max input)

### Model Selection

- **Recommended**: Use a lightweight, cost-effective model for summaries
  - Examples: `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-haiku`, or equivalent
  - Summaries don't require the most powerful models
  - Significant cost savings on high-volume applications

- **Default**: If `model_name` is `null`, summarizes with the run's own model (not `models[0]`)
  - Keeps compaction working when `models[0]`'s provider is broken but the run's model is healthy
  - Good for simple setups; no separate summary provider to keep credentialed

### Optimization Tips

1. **Balance triggers**: Combine token and message triggers for robust handling
   ```yaml
   trigger:
     - type: tokens
       value: 4000
     - type: messages
       value: 50
   ```

2. **Conservative retention**: Keep more messages initially, adjust based on performance
   ```yaml
   keep:
     type: messages
     value: 25  # Start higher, reduce if needed
   ```

3. **Trim strategically**: Limit tokens sent to summarization model
   ```yaml
   trim_tokens_to_summarize: 4000  # Prevents expensive summarization calls
   ```

4. **Monitor and iterate**: Track summary quality and adjust configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Summary Quality Issues

**Problem**: Summaries losing important context

**Solutions**:
1. Increase `keep` value to preserve more messages
2. Decrease trigger thresholds to summarize earlier
3. Customize `summary_prompt` to emphasize key information
4. Use a more capable model for summarization

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Summarization calls taking too long

**Solutions**:
1. Use a faster model for summaries (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
2. Reduce `trim_tokens_to_summarize` to send less context
3. Increase trigger thresholds to summarize less frequently

### Token Limit Errors

**Problem**: Still hitting token limits despite summarization

**Solutions**:
1. Lower trigger thresholds to summarize earlier
2. Reduce `keep` value to preserve fewer messages
3. Check if individual messages are very large
4. Consider using fraction-based triggers

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

- **Configuration**: `packages/harness/deerflow/config/summarization_config.py`
- **Integration**: `packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/agent.py`
- **Middleware**: Uses `langchain.agents.middleware.SummarizationMiddleware`

### Middleware Order

Durable context capture runs before summarization so task delegations and
loaded skill references are recorded before their raw tool messages can be
compacted. It records in-progress dispatches as well as terminal result
summaries. Summarization then reduces message history before downstream
middlewares such as title generation, memory queuing, and clarification:

1. Runtime middlewares, including ThreadData and Sandbox initialization
2. DynamicContextMiddleware
3. SkillActivationMiddleware
4. DurableContextMiddleware
5. **SummarizationMiddleware** ← Runs here
6. Downstream lead middlewares such as Title, Memory, and Clarification

### State Management

- Summarization configuration is loaded from `config.yaml`
- Generated summaries are stored in `ThreadState.summary_text`, not as regular `messages`
- The message reducer removes compacted raw messages while the checkpointer persists `summary_text`
- DurableContextMiddleware projects `summary_text` back into later model calls as hidden durable context data
