"""Build the GitHub webhook → agent registry.

Indexes every custom agent that declares a ``github:`` block by the
``(repo, event)`` pairs it is interested in, across all owners. Agent discovery
and change detection go through the configured agent store
(:mod:`deerflow.persistence.agents`), so both the ``file`` backend (per-user
directories + the legacy shared layout) and the ``db`` backend (the shared
``agents`` table) are covered by the same code.

The dispatcher calls :func:`build_github_agent_registry` once per webhook
delivery. We avoid re-loading every agent on each call via a small cache keyed
on the store's :meth:`~deerflow.persistence.agents.base.AgentStore.signature`
change token: the file backend derives it from ``config.yaml`` mtimes (any
edit, addition, or deletion invalidates the cache transparently); the db backend
derives it from a deterministic digest of each agent's owner, name, config, and
soul. Operators who hand-edit a ``config.yaml`` see the change on the next
webhook.

Cache invalidation caveat (file backend): mtime granularity on macOS HFS+ /
APFS is ~1 µs but on some filesystems (FAT, network shares with caching) it's
1 s. Two edits inside the same coarse-tick would look identical. For the
dispatch path that's fine — webhooks are rare relative to operator edits, and
the next non-coincident write reconciles.

    here also folds the per-binding lookup out of the hot path: the registry
    already chose the right binding for this ``(repo, event)``, so the

    which silently dropped events when an agent had multiple bindings on
    one repo (PR feedback R3) — disappears entirely. Single-binding-per-repo
    is enforced upstream by :class:`GitHubAgentConfig`'s validator, so
    each ``(repo, event)`` resolves to exactly one trigger per agent.

    The ``github:`` block is read off ``agent.github`` (always non-None
    here — the rebuild filters agents without one before constructing a
    match), so we don't carry a separate ``github`` field.
