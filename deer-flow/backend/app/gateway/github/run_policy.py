"""Per-run policy hooks for the GitHub channel.

The generic ``ChannelManager`` looks up a :class:`ChannelRunPolicy`
keyed on ``msg.channel_name`` and applies it after ``_resolve_run_params``
but before the agent runs. The GitHub channel registers its policy
entry from :func:`register_policy`, called once from the gateway
bootstrap.

Keeping the GitHub-specific provider closure here (rather than inline
in ``ChannelManager``) lets every new webhook channel ship its own
``run_policy.py`` with the same shape, with no edits to the manager.

    """Install a GitHub App installation token in ``run_context``.

    The GitHub fan-out dispatcher carries each binding's
    ``installation_id`` in ``msg.metadata["github"]``. We mint a
    short-lived (1h) installation token and put the resulting **string**
    into ``run_context["github_token"]``.

    Why a string and not a closure:
        ``run_context`` is passed to ``client.runs.wait(context=…)``
        on the ``langgraph_sdk`` HTTP client, which JSON-encodes the
        payload before sending it to Gateway's LangGraph-compatible
        runtime over HTTP — even when that runtime is embedded in the
        same process. A Python callable does not survive that
        encoding (``TypeError: Type is not JSON serializable: function``).
        The harness side (``_github_env_from_runtime`` in
        ``packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/tools.py``) already accepts
        either a ``str`` or a zero-arg sync callable from
        ``runtime.context["github_token"]``; only the ``str`` shape
        round-trips through the SDK transport, so that is what we
        ship.

    Failure modes for autonomous runs that span past the 1h token TTL:
        The minted token is valid for 1h. Most agent runs complete well
        inside that window. Truly long coder runs (multi-hour refactors
        on the higher ``recursion_limit=250`` ceiling) may see a 401 on
        a late ``git push`` / ``gh pr create``. The fix for that —
        re-installing a token-refresh hook on the **runtime side** by
        pushing the ``installation_id`` through ``run_context`` and
        looking up a process-local provider in the harness — is
        deliberately deferred: it crosses the harness/app boundary
        (``tests/test_harness_boundary.py``) and needs a registered
        token-provider lookup, not a string-vs-closure switch.

    Minting on the bus-consumer side (not in the webhook route) keeps
    GitHub's 10s delivery timeout safe. Mint failures propagate up to
    :meth:`ChannelManager._apply_channel_policy`, which logs and lets
    the run proceed without credentials (read-only is better than no
    response).
