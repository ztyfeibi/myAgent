"""Fan out a verified GitHub webhook delivery onto the channel bus.

This module replaces the old "build prompt, create thread, run agent,
post comment" one-shot dispatcher.  In the new architecture GitHub is a
first-class :class:`Channel` (see ``app/channels/github.py``):

    POST /api/webhooks/github
        → verify HMAC (route)
        → :func:`fanout_event` (this module)
            • look up bound agents
            • filter bots
            • drop redundant review-comment webhook noise, per binding
            • apply per-binding trigger filter
            • publish one :class:`InboundMessage` per surviving agent
        → ChannelManager picks it up off the bus
            • resolves run params (agent_name comes from message metadata)
            • creates thread / runs lead_agent with the custom-agent name
            • publishes outbound message
        → GitHubChannel.send() posts the reply as a GitHub comment

The webhook handler stays cheap (no langgraph calls) so GitHub's 10-second
delivery timeout is never at risk.

    Checks whether ``sender.login`` (with the ``[bot]`` suffix stripped)
    matches one of the agent's self-identities. In order of preference:

    1. ``github.bot_login`` — the explicit GitHub App login this agent
       posts as. Set this when the agent's ``mention_login`` (the handle
       humans type to invoke it) differs from its actual posting identity.
    2. Every ``mention_login`` declared across the agent's bindings — the
       posting identity may match any handle the agent listens for, so we
       aggregate across all bindings, not just the one for the current

    3. The agent's own ``name`` as a final fallback — but ONLY when neither
       of the above is configured. Otherwise a real GitHub user whose

       (``^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$``), so collisions like ``reviewer`` or ``coder``
       are entirely possible.

    This is the per-agent self-loop gate: we skip events triggered by our

    the reviewer) but NOT events from other bots like Copilot or CodeRabbit —

def _is_redundant_review_comment(payload: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Return True if this ``pull_request_review_comment`` has the *shape*
    of fan-out noise from a ``pull_request_review`` submission: a companion
    inline comment that the review event already covers.

    GitHub fires one ``pull_request_review_comment`` webhook per inline
    comment attached to a review submission, ON TOP OF the single
    ``pull_request_review`` event for the review as a whole. A bot
    reviewer (CodeRabbit routinely posts 20-30 inline comments per review)
    therefore floods the webhook with 20-30 near-duplicate deliveries.

    Each such companion comment carries ``pull_request_review_id`` (the id
    of the review it belongs to) and — the discriminator — no
    ``in_reply_to_id``. ``in_reply_to_id`` is only set when a human (or
    bot) is replying *within* an existing review-comment thread, which is
    a genuine new interaction, not fan-out, and must still fire.

    This mirrors the shape GitHub's REST API has always used for
    review-thread comments (``GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments``),
    which the webhook ``comment`` object is drawn from:
    ``pull_request_review_id`` is present on every review-thread comment;
    ``in_reply_to_id`` is present only on replies.

    IMPORTANT: a ``True`` result is NOT by itself a "safe to drop" signal —
    see the per-binding gate in :func:`fanout_event`, which only suppresses
    a companion comment for a binding that *also* has its own
    ``pull_request_review`` trigger on the same repo AND whose *resolved*
    trigger does not itself require a mention (see the ``require_mention``
    gap note below) — i.e. an unconditional, independent path to the
    review. A binding that subscribes to ``pull_request_review_comment``
    alone never receives the parent review event, so unconditionally
    dropping its companion comments would be a silent, total loss of the
    review's inline content for it — not noise reduction (PR #4131 review
    feedback from willem-bd / zhfeng).

    ``require_mention`` gap (PR #4131 review, Medium finding, willem-bd —
    second round, against the per-binding gate above): a dual-subscribed
    binding's ``pull_request_review`` trigger is only a *guaranteed*
    independent path when that trigger does not itself gate on
    ``require_mention``. If it does, the paired review event can be
    silently dropped by :func:`app.gateway.github.triggers.event_should_fire`'s
    own mention check against ``review["body"]`` — the review's
    *top-level* summary, which this ``pull_request_review_comment``
    payload never carries (there is no way to see, from a comment
    delivery, what the sibling review's own summary said). A human
    ``@mention`` that lives only inside one inline comment — not the
    review summary — would otherwise be lost twice over: the review event
    is filtered out (``no_mention``) *and* the one inline comment that
    actually carries the mention is dropped here as "redundant", via a
    narrower path than the original bug. The per-binding gate therefore
    additionally requires ``require_mention`` to be false on the paired
    trigger before treating it as coverage. This trades a small amount of
    residual redundancy (an extra companion delivery on occasions when the
    review's own summary happened to carry the mention too, or
    ``allow_authors``/self-event would have let the review through anyway)
    for zero silent loss — the same trade the original fix already made at
    a coarser grain. It deliberately does not attempt to replay
    ``allow_authors`` or an ``actions`` whitelist that might also be
    configured on the paired trigger; those are accepted as out of scope
    for this narrower fix, same as ``self_event``.

    Residual caveat (PR #4131 review, Concern 3, zhfeng): GitHub documents
    ``pull_request_review_id`` on the review-comment schema as nullable
    ("integer or null"), confirming *some* review comments can lack a
    backing review, but public docs do not state whether the "Add single
    comment" UI action (as opposed to a multi-comment review) can ever
    produce a comment with ``pull_request_review_id`` set and
    ``in_reply_to_id`` absent *without* a companion ``pull_request_review``
    event also firing. If that combination is possible, a binding with its
    own ``pull_request_review`` trigger could still lose such a comment
    under the per-binding gate. Confirmed via a real/documented webhook
    payload capture before ruling this out; treat it as an open,
    low-probability risk rather than a settled non-issue. (Distinct from
    the ``require_mention`` gap above: this caveat questions whether the
    paired event fires *at all* for a given delivery shape; the
    ``require_mention`` gap is about a paired event that fires but is then
    filtered by its own trigger config, which the gate now accounts for.)
