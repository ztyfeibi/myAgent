"""Centralized accessors for singleton objects stored on ``app.state``.

**Getters** (used by routers): raise 503 when a required dependency is
missing, except ``get_store`` which returns ``None``.

``AppConfig`` is intentionally *not* cached on ``app.state``. Routers and the
run path resolve it through :func:`deerflow.config.app_config.get_app_config`,
which performs mtime-based hot reload, so edits to ``config.yaml`` take
effect on the next request without a process restart. The engines created in
:func:`langgraph_runtime` (stream bridge, persistence, checkpointer, store,
run-event store) accept a ``startup_config`` snapshot — they are
restart-required by design and stay bound to that snapshot to keep the live
process consistent with itself.

Initialization is handled directly in ``app.py`` via :class:`AsyncExitStack`.
