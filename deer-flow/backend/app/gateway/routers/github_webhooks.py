"""Gateway router for inbound GitHub webhook deliveries.

Receives GitHub App / repository webhook events at ``POST /api/webhooks/github``.
This route is intentionally exempt from both the auth and CSRF middleware
(see ``auth_middleware._PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`` and
``csrf_middleware.should_check_csrf``) because GitHub neither sends a
session cookie nor an ``X-CSRF-Token`` header.

Authenticity is enforced via the HMAC-SHA256 signature in the
``X-Hub-Signature-256`` request header, compared in constant time against
the shared secret in the ``GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` environment variable.

**The route is fail-closed by default.** If ``GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` is
unset, the route is not mounted at all (`/api/webhooks/github` responds
404) so a misconfigured deployment cannot accept forged deliveries. Set
``DEER_FLOW_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_GITHUB_WEBHOOKS=1`` to mount the route
anyway for local development or loopback testing — every delivery is
then accepted unverified with a WARNING log line.

After verification the payload is fanned out by :func:`fanout_event` into
:class:`InboundMessage` instances on the channel bus, one per matching
custom agent binding. The :class:`GitHubChannel` (registered alongside
Feishu/Slack/etc.) takes care of posting the agent's reply back to GitHub.

    - Verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature against ``GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET``.
    - Logs the event + delivery id + a one-line payload summary.
    - Returns ``{"ok": True, ...}`` on successful (or no-op) dispatch so
      GitHub marks the delivery successful and does not retry.

    **Transient fan-out failures return 503**, not 200. GitHub does NOT
    automatically retry a failed delivery of any kind — 5xx, timeout, or
    connection error are all simply recorded as failed; see
    https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/handling-failed-webhook-deliveries.
    Swallowing a transient registry filesystem error or bus publish
    failure into a 200 would mark the delivery successful, so it never
    surfaces as failed in GitHub's Recent Deliveries / Deliveries API and
    a scheduled recovery script filtering on non-OK status (the pattern
    GitHub's own docs recommend) will never flag it for redelivery. That
    is a discoverability problem, not literal unrecoverability — GitHub's
    manual "Redeliver" button and its REST/App redelivery endpoints place
    no failed-status precondition on the delivery id (see
    https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/testing-and-troubleshooting-webhooks/redelivering-webhooks),
    so an operator who independently identifies this exact delivery can
    still redeliver it by hand within GitHub's ~3-day redelivery window —
    they just get no automated signal telling them to. Returning 503
    keeps the delivery correctly recorded as failed instead, so that same
    manual click, REST call, or recovery script actually finds it rather
    than merely being capable of redelivering it if asked, well inside
    the window the underlying outage usually clears in. The
    `is_route_enabled()` startup check still handles *configuration*
    errors fail-closed (route absent → 404); 503 is reserved for runtime
    failures worth making discoverable and recoverable this way.
    Permanent / non-retryable conditions (unknown event, missing channel
    service) keep returning 200.

    The route is fail-closed: :func:`is_route_enabled` should have already
    prevented this handler from being mounted when no secret is configured.
    The runtime guard below is a defense-in-depth fallback in case
    ``GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` was unset *after* startup (e.g. an operator
    rotating env vars without restarting) — without the secret and without
    the explicit unverified opt-in, return 503 rather than accept a
